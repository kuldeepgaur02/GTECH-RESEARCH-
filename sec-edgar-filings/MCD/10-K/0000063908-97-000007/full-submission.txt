                                     PART I

     Item 1.   Business

          McDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its
     subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company".

          (a)  General development of business

           There have been no significant changes to the Company's
     corporate structure during 1996, nor material changes in the Company's
     method of conducting business.

          (b)  Financial information about industry segments

           Industry segment data for the years ended December 31, 1996,
     1995 and 1994 is included in Part II, item 8, page    of this
     Form 10-K.

          (c)  Narrative description of business

          General

           The Company develops, operates, franchises and services a
     worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, assemble, package and
     sell a limited menu of value-priced foods. These restaurants are
     operated by the Company or, under the terms of franchise arrangements,
     by franchisees who are independent third parties, or by affiliates
     operating under joint-venture agreements between the Company and local
     businesspeople.

           The Company's franchising program is designed to assure
     consistency and quality.  The Company is selective in granting
     franchises and is not in the practice of franchising to investor
     groups or passive investors.  Under the conventional franchise
     arrangement, franchisees supply capital - initially, by purchasing
     equipment, signs, seating, and decor, and over the long term, by
     reinvesting in the business.  The Company shares the investment by
     owning or leasing the land and building; franchisees then contribute
     to the Company's revenues through payment of rent and service fees
     based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum payments.
     Generally, the conventional franchise arrangement lasts 20 years and
     franchising practices are consistent throughout the world.  Further
     discussion regarding site selection is included in Part I, item 2,
     page   of this Form 10-K.

           Training begins at the restaurant with one-on-one instruction
     and videotapes.  Aspiring restaurant managers progress through a
     development program of classes in basic and intermediate operations,
     management and equipment.  Assistant managers are eligible to attend
     the advanced operations and management class at one of the five
     Hamburger University (H.U.) campuses in the U.S., Germany, England,
     Japan or Australia.  The curriculum at H.U. concentrates on skills and
     practices essential to delivering customer satisfaction and running a
     restaurant business.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 4
           The Company's global brand is well-known. Marketing and
     promotional activities are designed to nurture this brand image and
     differentiate the Company from competitors by focusing on value, taste
     and customer satisfaction.  Funding for promotions is handled at the
     local restaurant level; funding for regional and national efforts is
     handled through advertising cooperatives.  Franchised, Company-
     operated and affiliated restaurants throughout the world make
     voluntary contributions to cooperatives which purchase media.
     Production costs for certain advertising efforts are borne by the
     Company.

          Products

           McDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu
     consisting of hamburgers and cheeseburgers, including the Big Mac,
     Quarter Pounder with Cheese and Arch Deluxe sandwiches, the Fish Filet
     Deluxe, Grilled Chicken Deluxe and Cripsy Chicken Deluxe, french
     fries, Chicken McNuggets, salads, milk shakes, sundaes and cones,
     pies, cookies and a limited number of soft drinks and other beverages.
     In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of products during limited
     promotional time periods.  McDonald's restaurants operating in the
     United States are open during breakfast hours and offer a full
     breakfast menu including the Egg McMuffin and the Sausage McMuffin
     with Egg sandwiches, hotcakes and sausage; three varieties of biscuit
     sandwiches; and Apple-Bran muffins.  McDonald's restaurants in many
     countries around the world offer many of these same products as well
     as other products and limited breakfast menus. The Company tests new
     products on an ongoing basis.

           The Company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food
     products and packaging from numerous independent suppliers.  Quality
     specifications for both raw and cooked food products are established
     and strictly enforced.  Alternative sources of these items are
     generally available.  Quality assurance labs in the U.S., Europe and
     the Pacific work to ensure that the Company's high standards are
     consistently met.  The quality assurance process involves ongoing
     testing and on-site inspections of suppliers' facilities.
     Independently owned and operated distribution centers distribute
     products and supplies to most McDonald's restaurants.  The restaurants
     then prepare, assemble and package these products using specially
     designed production techniques and equipment to obtain uniform
     standards of quality.

          Trademarks and patents

           The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, some
     of which, including "McDonald's", "Ronald McDonald" and other related
     marks, are of material importance to the Company's business. The
     Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while
     valuable, are not material to its business.

          Seasonal operations

           The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to
     any material degree.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 5
          Working capital practices

           Information about the Company's working capital practices is
     incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and
     Analysis of the Company's financial position and the consolidated
     statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995
     and 1994 in Part II, item 7, pages    through   , and Part II, item 8,
     page    of this Form 10-K.

          Customers

           The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer
     or small group of customers.

          Backlog

           Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.

          Government contracts

           No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation
     of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election
     of the U.S. government.

          Competition

           McDonald's restaurants compete with international, national,
     regional, and local retailers of food products.  The Company competes
     on the basis of price and service and by offering quality food
     products.  The Company's competition in the broadest perspective
     includes restaurants, quick-service eating establishments, pizza
     parlors, coffee shops, street vendors, convenience food stores,
     delicatessens, and supermarket freezers.

           In the U.S., about 424,000 restaurants generate nearly $238
     billion in annual sales.  McDonald's accounts for about 2.7% of those
     restaurants and approximately 6.9% of those sales.  No reasonable
     estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside of the U.S.;
     however, the Company's business in foreign markets continues to grow.

          Research and development

           The Company operates research and development facilities in
     Illinois. While research and development activities are important to
     the Company's business, these expenditures are not material.
     Independent suppliers also conduct research activities for the benefit
     of the McDonald's System, which includes franchisees and suppliers, as
     well as McDonald's, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 6
          Environmental matters

           The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local
     environmental laws or regulations which will materially affect its
     earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital
     expenditures; however, the Company cannot predict the effect on its
     operations of possible future environmental legislation or
     regulations. During 1996, there were no material capital expenditures
     for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures
     are anticipated.

          Number of employees

           During 1996, the Company's average number of employees
     worldwide, including company-operated restaurant employees, was
     approximately 237,000.

          (d)  Financial information about foreign and domestic operations

           Financial information about foreign and domestic markets is
     incorporated herein by reference from Selected Financial Data,
     Management's Discussion and Analysis and Segment and Geographic
     Information in Part II, item 6, page   , Part II, item 7, pages
     through    and Part II, item 8, page   , respectively, of this Form
     10-K.

     Item 2.   Properties

           The Company identifies and develops sites that offer
     convenience to customers and provide for long-term sales and profit
     potential.  To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and
     walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant
     data.  The Company's experience and access to advanced technology aids
     in evaluating this information.  In order to ensure long-term
     occupancy and control of the related costs, the Company owns
     restaurant sites and buildings or secures long-term leases.
     Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is
     important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to lower average
     development costs through construction and design efficiencies,
     standardization and by leveraging the Company's global sourcing
     system.  Additional information about the Company's properties is
     included in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the related
     financial statements and footnotes in Part II, item 7, pages
     through    and Part II, item 8, pages          respectively, of this
     Form 10-K.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

           The Company has pending a number of lawsuits which have been
     filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover
     a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's entire business.
     The following is a brief description of the more significant of these
     categories of lawsuits and government regulations.  The Company does
     not believe that any such claims or lawsuits will have a material
     adverse affect on its financial condition or results of operations.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 7
          Franchising

           A substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised
     to independent businesspeople operating under arrangements with the
     Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional
     disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a
     broad range of subjects including, without limitation, quality,
     service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or
     terminations of franchises, franchisee claims for additional
     franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments.

          Suppliers

           The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply,
     with minor exceptions outside of the United States, food, paper, or
     related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon
     independent suppliers which are required to meet and maintain the
     Company's standards and specifications. There are a number of such
     suppliers worldwide and on occasion disputes arise between the Company
     and its suppliers on a number of issues including, by way of example,
     compliance with product specifications and McDonald's business
     relationship with suppliers.

          Employees

           Thousands of persons are employed by the Company and in
     restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In
     addition, thousands of persons, from time to time, seek employment in
     such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise
     regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.

          Customers

           McDonald's restaurants serve a large cross-section of the
     public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as
     to products, service, accidents and other matters typical of an
     extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.

          Trademarks

           McDonald's has registered trademarks and service marks, some of
     which are of material importance to the Company's business.  From time
     to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to defend and
     protect its use of such registered marks.

          Government Regulations

           Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and
     regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business,
     including, but not limited to, franchising, health, environment,
     zoning and employment. The Company does not believe that it is in
     violation of any existing statutory or administrative rules, but it
     cannot predict the effect on its operations from promulgation of
     additional requirements in the future.<PAGE>

           The approximate number of shareholders of record and beneficial
     owners of the Company's common stock as of January 31, 1997 was
     estimated to be 925,000.

           Given the Company's returns on equity and assets, the Company's
     management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of
     earnings back into the business.  The Company has paid 84 consecutive
     quarterly dividends on common stock through March 28, 1997, has
     increased the per share amount 22 times since the first dividend was
     paid in 1976, and has increased the dividend amount every year.
     Additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing
     returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing
     needs.<PAGE>

     CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     SYSTEMWIDE SALES AND RESTAURANTS
     Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by
     the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint-
     venture agreements.  Sales increases in 1996 and 1995 were primarily
     due to restaurant expansion worldwide.  In 1996, sales were affected
     adversely by negative U.S. comparable sales and weaker foreign
     currencies.  In 1995, sales benefited from stronger foreign currencies
     and higher comparable sales.  Sales by Company-operated restaurants
     grew at a higher rate than Systemwide sales in 1996 and 1995.  This
     was because both expansion and comparable sales at Company-operated
     restaurants increased at a higher rate than at Systemwide restaurants.

       Expansion continued at an accelerated pace in 1996 as 2,642
     restaurants were added Systemwide (1,995 traditional and 647
     satellites).  This compares with 2,430 in 1995 (1,604 traditional and
     826 satellites), and 1,787 in 1994 (1,212 traditional and 575
     satellites).  Systemwide restaurants opened during the year
     contributed $1.4 billion to Systemwide sales in 1996, $1.2 billion in
     1995 and $.9 billion in 1994.
       McDonald's plans to add between 2,400 and 2,800 restaurants in
     1997, with a greater emphasis on full-menu traditional restaurants and
     international locations than in 1996.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 12
     TOTAL REVENUES
     Total revenues include sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees
     from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates.  These fees
     are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments.  The
     minimum fee includes both a rent and service fee that amount to about
     12.5% of sales for new U.S. franchise arrangements, compared with
     about 12.0% prior to 1994.  Fees vary by type of site and investment
     required by the Company, and also according to local business
     conditions outside the U.S.  These fees, along with occupancy and
     operating rights, are stipulated in franchise agreements that
     generally have 20-year terms.  Accordingly, these fees provide a
     stable, predictable revenue flow to the Company.
       Revenues grow as new restaurants are added and as sales build in
     existing restaurants.  Menu price changes also affect revenues and
     sales, but it is impractical to quantify their Systemwide impact
     because of different pricing structures, new products, promotions and
     product mix variations among restaurants and markets.
       Total revenues for 1996 and 1995 increased due to strong global
     operating results and an increase in Company-operated restaurants
     through expansion and changes in ownership.  Negative U.S. comparable
     sales and weaker foreign currencies had an adverse impact on 1996
     revenues, while positive comparable sales and stronger foreign
     currencies contributed to the 1995 increase.
       In 1996, 63% of sales by Company-operated restaurants and 42% of
     revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants were generated
     outside the U.S., up from 60% and 40%, respectively, in 1995.<PAGE>

     RESTAURANT MARGINS
     Margins for Company-operated restaurants were 18.6% of sales in 1996,
     compared with 19.2% in 1995 and 19.8% in 1994.  As a percent of 1996
     and 1995 sales, occupancy and other operating costs increased; payroll
     costs remained relatively flat; and food and paper costs declined in
     1996 and increased in 1995.
       Franchised restaurant margin dollars made up about two-thirds of
     the combined operating margins in both 1996 and 1995.  Franchised
     margins were 81.7% of applicable 1996 revenues, down from 82.4% in
     1995 and 82.8% in 1994.  The decreases for both years were partly due
     to a higher proportion of leased sites.  For leased sites, financing
     costs are included in rent expense, which affects margins; for owned
     sites, financing costs are reflected in interest expense.  The 1996
     decrease was also partly attributable to negative U.S. comparable
     sales.
       Franchised margins include revenues and expenses from restaurants
     operating under business facilities lease arrangements.  Under these
     arrangements, the Company leases the businesses, including equipment,
     to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses.  Higher
     fees are charged but margins are generally lower because of equipment
     depreciation.  The Company is compensated for lower margins by the
     subsequent gains realized from the exercise of purchase options,
     accounted for as other operating income.  There were 627 restaurants
     operating under such arrangements at year-end 1996, compared with 491
     in 1995 and 484 in 1994.  The majority of these were outside the U.S.

     GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SELLING EXPENSES
     Increases in 1996 and 1995 were primarily due to strategic global
     investments supporting the Convenience, Value and Execution
     Strategies.  These investments included costs associated with
     accelerated expansion, continued investment in developing countries
     and new U.S. food initiatives.  Weaker foreign currencies reduced 1996
     expenses slightly, while stronger foreign currencies increased 1995
     expenses.  These expenses have been relatively constant as a percent
     of Systemwide sales at 4.3% in 1996, 4.1% in 1995 and 4.2% in 1994.
       Corporate general, administrative and selling expenses not
     allocated to geographic business segments were $52 million in 1996 and
     $48 million in both 1995 and 1994.

     OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE-NET
     This category includes gains on sales of restaurant businesses, equity
     in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net gains or losses from
     property dispositions and other transactions related to the
     foodservice business.  The decline in other operating income in 1996
     was principally due to the $72 million special charge related
     primarily to plans to strengthen the U.S. business and reduce ongoing
     costs, and the $16 million charge related to the adoption of Statement
     of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the
     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
     Disposed of (SFAS 121).  Other operating income was positively
     affected by higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses and lower
     provisions for property dispositions, partly offset by lower income
     from affiliates.  Income from affiliates declined in 1996, despite
     stronger operating results, principally due to a weaker Japanese Yen.
     The 1995 other operating income increase was due to higher income from
     affiliates, principally Japan, partly offset by higher losses on
     property dispositions.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 15
       Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of
     Company-operated restaurants, as well as gains from exercises of
     purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease
     arrangements.  The Company's purchase and sale of businesses with its
     franchisees and affiliates is aimed at achieving an optimal ownership
     mix in each market.  As an integral part of our franchising business,
     these transactions and resulting gains are recorded in operating
     income.
       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates - businesses the
     Company actively participates in, but does not control - is reported
     after interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. restaurant
     partnerships, which are reported before income taxes.
       Net gains or losses from property dispositions result from
     disposals of properties no longer needed due to restaurant closings,
     relocations and other transactions.

     OPERATING INCOME
     Operating income of $2.6 billion was negatively affected by the $72
     million special charge and the $16 million SFAS 121 charge.  Excluding
     these charges, operating income would have increased 5% in 1996, due
     to higher combined operating margin dollars and higher other operating
     income, partly offset by higher general, administrative and selling
     expenses and weaker foreign currencies.  The 1995 increase reflected
     higher combined operating margin dollars and stronger foreign
     currencies, partly offset by higher general, administrative and
     selling expenses.

     INTEREST EXPENSE
     Higher average debt levels, partly offset by lower average interest
     rates, accounted for the 1996 and 1995 increases.  Weaker foreign
     currencies reduced the increase in 1996, while stronger foreign
     currencies contributed to the increase in 1995.

     NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)-NET
     The decrease in this category - which includes interest income, gains
     and losses related to investments and financings, and miscellaneous
     income and expense - reflected lower losses in 1996 associated with
     the Company's investment in Discovery Zone common stock.  Losses of
     $22 million in 1996 reduced the carrying value of this investment to
     zero, compared with losses of $60 million in 1995.  The decrease in
     expense also reflected foreign currency translation gains in 1996,
     compared with translation losses in 1995.  The 1995 increase in
     expense also included higher charges associated with minority
     interests, partly offset by higher interest income and lower
     translation losses.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 16
     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
     The effective income tax rate was 30.1% for 1996, compared with 34.2%
     for 1995 and 35.1% for 1994.  A $50 million tax benefit resulting from
     certain international transactions was primarily responsible for the
     unusually low rate in 1996.  Excluding this benefit, the 1996
     effective income tax rate would have been 32.4%, reflecting lower
     taxes related to foreign operations.  The Company expects its 1997
     effective income tax rate to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%.
       Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net
     of valuation allowance, of $305 million in 1996 and $308 million in
     1995.  Substantially all of the tax assets arose in the U.S. and other
     profitable markets, and a majority of them are expected to be realized
     in future U.S. income tax returns.

     NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
     Net income and net income per common share increased 10% and 12%,
     respectively, in 1996 and 17% each in 1995.  Excluding the charge for
     the adoption of SFAS 121, net income and net income per common share
     increased 11% and 13% in 1996.  The spread between the percent
     increase in net income and net income per common share in 1996
     reflected the impact of share repurchase as well as lower preferred
     stock dividends.  Lower dividends were due to the conversion of 11
     million shares of Series B and C preferred stock into 8.7 million
     shares of common stock in 1995, which offset the impact of share
     repurchase in 1995.

     IMPACT OF CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCIES
     While changes in foreign currency values affect reported results, the
     Company reduces short-term cash exposures by financing and purchasing
     goods and services in local currencies and by hedging foreign currency
     cash flows.  Systemwide sales, revenues, operating income and net
     income were lower because of weaker foreign currencies in 1996, and
     benefited from stronger foreign currencies in 1995.
       If exchange rates had remained at 1995 levels, results would have
     been as follows:

     SALES
     Restaurant expansion was primarily responsible for increasing sales in
     1996 and 1995.  Comparable sales were positive in 1995 and negative in
     1996, reflecting an extremely competitive U.S. operating environment,
     and at times, severe weather and difficult comparisons.

     ========================================================================

       Average annual sales at U.S. restaurants in operation at least 13
     consecutive months were $1,439,000 in 1996 and $1,538,000 in 1995.
     Average sales declined due to lower average sales for new, smaller
     restaurants (including satellites) and lower sales at existing
     restaurants.  Unit expansion also affects average sales as new
     restaurants take about four years to reach long-term volumes.  The
     Company believes that average sales will continue to be affected by
     expansion into smaller, lower-cost sites which profitably support
     lower average volumes.

     RESTAURANTS
     There were 726 restaurants added in the U.S. in 1996 (542 traditional
     and 184 satellites), compared with 1,130 in 1995 (597 traditional and
     533 satellites), and 188 (all traditional) five years ago.  The U.S.
     accounted for 27% of Systemwide restaurants opened in 1996, compared
     with 47% in 1995 and 31% five years ago.  The 1996 decrease is
     consistent with our decision to reduce our focus on satellites and
     open fewer total restaurants in the U.S.

       Expansion favorably affected U.S. revenues in 1996 and 1995, as did
     positive comparable sales in 1995.
       U.S. Company-operated margins decreased $23 million in 1996 and $3
     million in 1995, as lower comparable sales and higher costs more than
     offset the positive impact of an expanded Company-operated store base
     for a majority of the period.  These margins were 16.5% of sales in
     1996, compared with 17.7% in 1995 and 19.0% in 1994.  Higher payroll
     costs as a percent of sales, primarily due to increases in average
     hourly rates, pushed margins lower in 1996 and 1995.  Higher promotion
     costs as a percent of sales also had a negative impact on 1996
     margins.  Lower food and paper costs benefited margins in both 1996
     and 1995.
       U.S. franchised margins increased $36 million, or 2%, in 1996 and
     $109 million, or 8%, in 1995, driven by expansion.  These margins were
     81.6% of applicable revenues in 1996, compared with 82.6% in 1995 and
     83.2% in 1994.  Franchised margins as a percent of revenues declined
     in 1996 and 1995 because the increase in rent expense, resulting from
     the growth in leased sites, outpaced the growth in franchised
     revenues.  In addition, 1996 margins were affected by negative
     comparable sales.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 19
       Cost pressures on margins are expected to continue in 1997;
     therefore, our ability to maintain both Company-operated and
     franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues will depend
     largely on our success in building comparable sales.
       U.S. operating income decreased $108 million, or 9%, in 1996 and
     rose $35 million, or 3%, in 1995.  The 1996 decrease was principally
     due to the $72 million special charge related primarily to plans to
     strengthen the U.S. business and reduce ongoing costs.  The charge
     covered closing approximately 115 low-volume U.S. satellite
     restaurants, replacing certain restaurant equipment, outsourcing
     excess property management and implementing other cost efficiencies.
     Without the special charge, U.S. operating income would have decreased
     3% in 1996.  This decrease primarily reflected lower Company-operated
     margin dollars and higher general, administrative and selling
     expenses.  These expenses included higher employee costs and
     expenditures to support our Convenience, Value and Execution
     Strategies, partly offset by higher franchised margin dollars.  The
     1995 increase was due to higher combined restaurant margins, partly
     offset by higher general, administrative and selling expenses.
     Operating income included $396 million of depreciation and
     amortization in 1996, compared with $380 million in 1995 and $366
     million in 1994.
       In 1997, McDonald's focus will be to increase sales at existing
     restaurants through aggressive marketing, a national value initiative,
     improved food taste, better service and improved facilities.

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     U.S. assets increased $514 million, or 7%, in 1996 and $547 million,
     or 8%, in 1995.  These increases were due to expansion and increased
     reinvestment in existing restaurants since 1994.

       U.S. capital expenditures decreased $20 million, or 2%, in 1996,
     compared with an increase of $209 million, or 30%, in 1995.  These
     amounts excluded initial investments in equipment, signs, seating and
     decor, as well as ongoing reinvestment expenditures made by
     franchisees.  New restaurant expenditures decreased $43 million, or
     7%, as a result of fewer restaurant additions.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 20
       Expenditures for existing restaurants were made to achieve higher
     levels of customer satisfaction, implement technology to improve
     service and food quality, and enhance older facilities.  In 1996,
     strategic reinvestment to build sales included $37 million for indoor
     Ronald's Playplaces and $27 million for rebuilding restaurants to
     adjust to changing demographics, traffic patterns and market
     opportunities.  Over the past five years, the Company has invested $83
     million to replace older buildings with new, lower-cost, more-
     efficient restaurants.
       Other properties primarily included expenditures for office
     buildings and related furnishings.
       U.S. average development costs for traditional restaurants
     increased slightly in 1996 to $1,176,000, compared with $1,151,000 in
     1995 and $1,095,000 in 1994.  The increases were primarily due to
     higher site development and preparation costs.  Average development
     costs have decreased $227,000, or 16%, from 1991 levels.  Construction
     efficiencies and a shift toward smaller, lower-cost building designs
     since 1991 have contributed to this decrease.
       The Company intends to further control development costs through
     standardization, global sourcing, greater economies of scale and co-
     branded oil locations.  Our objective is to profitably expand into
     more locations, consistent with our goal of increasing market share
     with greater marketwide presence throughout the world.
        The Company generally purchases new properties or enters into
     long-term leases with purchase options.  This ensures long-term
     occupancy and control of related costs.  The Company owned 61% of its
     U.S. sites at year-end 1996, compared with 62% at year-end 1995.<PAGE>

     OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     SALES
     Increasing market share and customer satisfaction through expansion
     and value continue to be key strategic initiatives to build sales
     outside the U.S.  These sales rose 10% in 1996 and 27% in 1995.
     Increases were primarily due to aggressive expansion beginning in 1995
     and were achieved despite difficult economic conditions in several of
     the largest markets in both years.  Weaker foreign currencies and
     comparisons to exceptional 1995 performances in certain markets
     reduced the 1996 increase.  Positive comparable sales and stronger
     foreign currencies contributed to the 1995 increase.
       Revenues increased at a faster rate than sales in 1996 and 1995.
     This is primarily because the weakening Japanese Yen had a greater
     effect on sales than on revenues and unit growth rates were higher for
     Company-operated restaurants than franchised restaurants.

       In Asia/Pacific, strong sales increases in Australia, Hong Kong,
     Japan and New Zealand were driven by Extra Value Meal marketing
     campaigns and rapid restaurant expansion in 1996.
       In Europe, restaurant expansion and value continued to support
     sales growth in England, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden in 1996.
     Our restaurant base in Italy nearly tripled with the acquisition of
     about 80 Burghy restaurants in mid-1996.
       In Latin America, Brazil's sales growth returned to a more normal
     level in 1996, as the economy began to stabilize following tremendous
     sales growth in 1995, spurred by the mid-1994 economic reforms.  We
     are encouraged by Mexico's recent operating results despite its weak
     economy.
       Canada's 1996 sales growth continued to be hampered by slow
     economic growth and decreased consumer retail spending.
       Average annual sales at restaurants outside the U.S. in operation
     for at least 13 consecutive months were $2,157,000 in 1996 and
     $2,422,000 in 1995.  This decrease is due to several factors.  First,
     expansion in our largest markets is occurring in smaller cities and
     less-populated areas where smaller, less-costly buildings support
     lower average sales volumes.  Second, weaker foreign currencies
     contributed about $100,000 to the decline in 1996 average sales,
     whereas stronger foreign currencies increased the 1995 average.
     Additionally, the high unit expansion rate also affects average sales
     as new restaurants generally open at lower average volumes and build
     business over time.<PAGE>

     RESTAURANTS
     During the past five years, 61% of Systemwide restaurant additions
     have been outside the U.S.  In both 1996 and 1995, 55% of restaurants
     outside the U.S. were in the seven largest markets - Australia,
     Brazil, Canada, England, France, Germany and Japan.  In 1997, the
     seven largest markets are anticipated to open slightly more than 50%
     of the restaurants outside the U.S., while new and developing markets
     like Central Europe, China and the Middle East are expected to
     continue to represent a growing percent of restaurant growth.
       In 1996, Japan added 522 restaurants (155 traditional and 367
     satellites), representing 27% of restaurants opened outside the U.S.
     Japan's aggressive and profitable expansion was supported by reduced
     restaurant development costs achieved through standardization of
     building designs, utilization of smaller buildings and expansion into
     less populated areas.

       Restaurants outside the U.S. represented 58% of Systemwide Company-
     operated restaurants and 29% of Systemwide franchised restaurants at
     year-end 1996.  Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants
     outside the U.S. were in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Germany
     and Taiwan.  About 66% of franchised restaurants outside the U.S. were
     operated in Australia, Canada, England, Germany, France, Japan and the
     Netherlands.  Restaurants operated by affiliates were principally
     located in Japan and other Asian countries.
       Most of the satellite restaurants operated outside the U.S. were in
     Japan, Canada and Brazil.<PAGE>

     *Included the $16 million SFAS 121 charge.

       Operating income growth in 1996 and 1995 was driven by higher
     combined operating margin dollars resulting from expansion in both
     years, and in 1995, higher sales at existing restaurants.  The
     increases in 1996 were partly offset by a $16 million charge for the
     adoption of SFAS 121 related to restaurant sites in Mexico, and weaker
     foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen and Deutsche Mark.
     Operating income growth benefited from stronger foreign currencies in
     1995.
       The seven largest markets accounted for about 80% of total
     operating income outside the U.S. in 1996.  They also contributed 56%
     to growth of operating income outside the U.S., compared with 89% in
     1995.  Accelerating operating income growth in developing markets and
     weak economies in France and Germany were the primary reasons the
     seven largest markets contributed a smaller percent of the operating
     income growth in 1996 compared with 1995.
          Operations outside the U.S. continue to contribute a growing
     percent to consolidated results.<PAGE>

       Company-operated margins increased $114 million, or 14%, in 1996.
     Company-operated margins accounted for 80% of the operating income
     increase in 1996 and 53% in 1995.  Company-operated margin growth
     accounted for a larger portion of the 1996 operating income increase
     than in 1995, due to a decline in 1996 general, administrative and
     selling expense growth, the $16 million SFAS 121 charge and a decline
     in other operating income growth in 1996.  The seven largest markets
     contributed about 74% to Company-operated margins outside the U.S. and
     accounted for 59% of the increase over 1995.
       Company-operated margins as a percent of sales declined slightly in
     1996 to 19.8%, compared with 20.2% in 1995 and 20.5% in 1994.  The
     declines in the 1996 and 1995 margins partly resulted from strategic
     decisions in many markets to use incremental margin dollars gained
     through sales growth and cost efficiencies to deliver value to
     customers.  This helped drive market share and customer satisfaction
     in the major markets in 1996.
       Franchised margins grew $94 million, or 10%, in 1996, primarily due
     to expansion.  Franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues
     were 81.8% in 1996, compared with 82.1% in both 1995 and 1994.
       The Company believes it can maintain or improve both Company-
     operated and franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues in
     1997, by continuing to increase sales and revenues while lowering
     average operating and development costs.
       The 1996 and 1995 increases in general, administrative and selling
     expenses were caused principally by additional employee costs to fund
     accelerated expansion and continued investment in developing markets.
       Other operating income - composed of transactions related to
     franchising and the foodservice business - was relatively flat in
     1996, compared with 1995.  Strong 1996 operating results from
     affiliates, principally Japan, were offset by the weaker Japanese Yen.
     Also, gains on sales of restaurant businesses were higher in 1996
     compared with 1995.  The $16 million SFAS 121 charge in 1996 reduced
     the other operating income increase compared with 1995.  In 1995,
     other operating income increased primarily due to higher income from
     affiliates.<PAGE>

       In 1996, the Europe/Africa/Middle East/India segment accounted for
     60% of revenues and 63% of operating income outside the U.S.  The
     growth in revenues and operating income was $405 and $111 million,
     respectively, in 1996, compared with growth of $650 and $195 million,
     respectively, in 1995.  Weaker currencies partly offset this region's
     operating income increase over 1995 by 3%, or $29 million, compared
     with 1995, when stronger currencies helped operating income growth by
     11%, or $77 million. The decline from 1995 was also due to soft
     economies in France and Germany.  This was  partly offset by strong
     operating results in England and a slight benefit due to Russia's
     ownership change from an affiliate to a majority-owned subsidiary in
     March 1996.  England, France and Germany accounted for 79% of this
     segment's operating income in 1996, compared with 83% in 1995.
       Asia/Pacific revenues grew $262 and $280 million in 1996 and 1995,
     respectively, and operating income increased $48 and $76 million,
     respectively, in the same two years.  Weaker currencies partly offset
     this region's operating income increase over 1995 by 2%, or
     $5 million, compared with 1995, when stronger currencies helped
     operating income growth by 5%, or $12 million.  Despite strong
     operating results from our Asian affiliates, 1996 operating income
     growth was also adversely affected by nonrecurring income recognized
     in 1995.  Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan contributed 84% of
     this segment's operating income, compared with 86% in 1995.
       Excluding the impact of the weaker Yen, Japan had significant
     operating income growth in 1996.  Australia and Hong Kong also
     experienced strong local currency operating income growth in 1996,
     primarily because of higher sales at existing restaurants generated by
     aggressive value campaigns and accelerated expansion programs.
       Latin American revenues grew $89 million in 1996 and $223 million
     in 1995, while operating income decreased $19 million in 1996 and
     increased $57 million in 1995.  The 1996 operating income decrease was
     primarily due to the $16 million SFAS 121 charge for Mexico.  Mexico's
     operating results were also negatively affected by its weakened
     economy.  Brazil's operating income growth slowed as the market faced
     tough comparisons in the first half of 1996 due to tremendous sales
     and operating income growth in 1995.  Despite this, Brazil produced
     strong sales and operating income increases in 1996, primarily due to
     expanding its restaurant base by about 39% in 1996 and 25% in 1995.
       Canadian revenues increased $20 million in 1996 and $2 million in
     1995, while operating income increased $4 million in 1996 and
     decreased $2 million in 1995.  The 1996 operating income growth was
     primarily due to new restaurant growth of 10% and a decrease in
     general, administrative and selling expenses.  This was partly offset
     by a sales decline at existing restaurants due to the slow economy.<PAGE>

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Assets outside the U.S. rose $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 1996 due to
     expansion, partly offset by weaker foreign currencies.  In 1996, 59%
     of these assets were located in our six largest majority-owned
     markets - Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France and Germany -
     compared with 61% in 1995.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       In the past five years, nearly $5 billion has been invested outside
     the U.S.  Capital expenditures outside the U.S. rose $369 million, or
     32%, in 1996, reflecting rapid expansion in all geographic segments.
     In 1996, approximately 57% of capital expenditures outside the U.S.
     were invested in the six largest majority-owned markets, compared with
     60% in 1995.
       Average development costs in the six largest majority-owned markets
     were slightly more than one and a half times the U.S. average in 1996.
     These investments generally accommodate higher sales volumes than in
     the U.S.  While there is a range of costs and average sales levels
     among markets, generally, average development costs have continued to
     decline.  For example, in Europe, average development costs for the
     three largest markets declined 13% from 1995 to nearly double the U.S.
     average. Costs are declining because of construction and design
     efficiencies, standardization, global sourcing and a shift to smaller
     restaurants in some markets.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included dining room remodels
     to achieve increased levels of customer satisfaction and technology
     upgrades to improve service and food taste.  The majority of these
     expenditures were in Europe, Australia and Canada.
       Various laws and regulations make property acquisition and
     ownership difficult in certain markets.  Property is purchased when
     legally and economically feasible; otherwise, long-term leases are
     used.  In addition, certain markets have laws and customs that offer
     stronger tenancy rights than are available in the U.S.  The Company
     owned 36% of sites outside the U.S. at year-end 1996, compared with
     39% in 1995.  Including affiliates, real estate ownership was 29% and
     31% at year-end 1996 and 1995, respectively.
       Capital expenditures made by affiliates - which were not included
     in consolidated amounts - were approximately $410 million in 1996,
     compared with $258 million in 1995.  The 1996 increase was primarily
     used to fund rapid expansion in Japan, Argentina, Sweden, the
     Philippines and Singapore.<PAGE>

     FINANCIAL POSITION
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     TOTAL ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Total assets grew approximately $2 billion, or 13%, in 1996.  Net
     property and equipment represented 83% of total assets and rose $1.5
     billion.  Capital expenditures increased $349 million, or 17%, in
     1996, reflecting increased expansion and reinvestment in existing
     restaurants, partly offset by weaker foreign currencies.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS
     The Company believes that cash-flow measures are meaningful indicators
     of growth and financial strength.  Cash provided by operations has
     grown steadily over the past five years and increased $165 million, or
     7%, in 1996 and $370 million, or 19%, in 1995.  Cash provided by
     operations, along with other sources of cash such as borrowings, was
     used principally for capital expenditures, debt repayments, share
     repurchase and dividends.  Cash provided by operations exceeded
     capital expenditures in 1996 for the sixth consecutive year, and is
     expected to cover substantially all capital expenditures over the next
     several years.
       While cash generated is more than cash required, the Company also
     has the ability to meet short-term needs through commercial paper
     borrowings and line of credit agreements.  Accordingly, the current
     ratio of .52 at year-end 1996 has been purposefully maintained at a
     relatively low level.

     FINANCINGS
     The Company strives to minimize interest expense and the impact of
     fluctuating foreign currencies while maintaining its capacity to fund
     increased growth.  To do that, the Company generally finances long-
     term assets with long-term debt in the currencies in which the assets
     are denominated, while taking advantage of changing foreign currencies
     and interest rates when appropriate.
       The Company has used major capital markets as well as a variety of
     techniques to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest
     expense over the years.  For example, currency exchange agreements in
     conjunction with borrowings help obtain desired currencies at
     attractive rates and maturities.  Interest-rate exchange agreements
     effectively convert fixed-rate to floating-rate debt, or vice versa.
     Foreign currency debt has been used to lessen the impact of
     fluctuating foreign currencies on net income and shareholders' equity
     by designating these borrowings as hedges of intercompany financings
     or the Company's long-term investments in its foreign subsidiaries and
     affiliates.  Total foreign-denominated debt, including the effects of
     currency exchange agreements, was $4.9 and $4.3 billion at year-end
     1996 and 1995, respectively.

       The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in
     interest rates and foreign currencies by periodically retiring,
     redeeming and repurchasing debt; terminating exchange agreements; and
     using derivatives.  The Company does not use derivatives with a level
     of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged
     and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
     All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments.<PAGE>

       To minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on
     reported results, the Company actively hedges selected currencies,
     primarily to minimize the cash exposure of foreign currency royalty
     and other payments received in the U.S.  In addition, McDonald's
     restaurants purchase goods and services primarily in local currencies
     resulting in natural hedges, and the Company typically finances in
     local currencies, creating economic hedges. The Company's exposure is
     diversified among a broad basket of currencies.  At year-end 1996,
     assets in hyperinflationary markets were principally financed in U.S.
     Dollars.  The Company's largest net asset exposures (defined as
     foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) were as
     follows:

       Moody's and Standard & Poor's have rated McDonald's debt Aa2 and
     AA, respectively, since 1982.  Duff & Phelps began rating the debt in
     1990 and currently rates it AA+.  These strong ratings are important
     to the Company because of our global development plans.  The Company
     has not experienced, nor does it expect to experience, difficulty in
     obtaining financing or in refinancing existing debt.  At year-end
     1996, the Company and its subsidiaries had $1.2 billion available
     under line of credit agreements and $1.5 billion under shelf
     registrations for future debt issuance.

     TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     Total shareholders' equity rose $857 million, or 11%, in 1996,
     representing 50% of total assets at year-end.  Weaker foreign
     currencies decreased shareholders' equity by $88 million in 1996.
       One way to enhance common shareholder value is by using excess cash
     flow and debt capacity to repurchase shares.  The Company has
     repurchased $3.2 billion of its common stock, representing 142 million
     shares, over the past 10 years while maintaining a strong equity base
     for future expansion.  At year-end 1996, the market value of shares
     recorded as common stock in treasury was $6.2 billion, compared with a
     cost of $3.0 billion.
       In January 1996, the Company announced plans to repurchase $2.0
     billion of its common stock by year-end 1998.  In 1996, about 13
     million shares were repurchased for $605 million ($206 million of
     which completed our $1.0 billion three-year common share repurchase
     program announced in January 1994).  The Company repurchased
     approximately $321 million of its common stock in 1995.<PAGE>

     RETURNS
     Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while
     net income less preferred stock dividends (net of tax) is used to
     calculate return on average common equity.  Month-end balances are
     used to compute both average assets and average common equity.

     (As a percent)                 1996    1995     1994     1993     1992

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     *Excluded the $72 million special charge.

       Return on assets declined in 1996, as the increase in assets
     outpaced the growth in operating income.  Return on average assets was
     16.3% for 1996 when the impact of the $72 million special charge was
     included.  Return on common equity also declined in 1996, as the
     increase in equity exceeded net income growth.

     EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES-INFLATION
     The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost
     increases effectively.  This is because of rapid inventory turnover,
     the ability to adjust prices, cost controls and substantial property
     holdings - many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by
     debt made cheaper by inflation.  In hyperinflationary markets, menu
     board prices are typically adjusted to keep pace, mitigating the
     effect on reported results.

     FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
     Certain forward-looking statements are included in this annual
     report.  They use such words as ``may,'' ``will,'' ``expect,''
     "believe,'' ``plan'' and other similar terminology.  These
     statements reflect management's current expectations and involve a
     number of risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ
     materially due to changes in: global and local business and economic
     conditions; legislation and governmental regulation; competition;
     success of operating initiatives and advertising and promotional
     efforts; food, labor and other operating costs; availability and cost
     of land and construction; adoption of new or changes in accounting
     policies and practices; consumer preferences, spending patterns and
     demographic trends; political or economic instability in local
     markets; and currency exchange rates.<PAGE>

     FINANCIAL COMMENTS

     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
     Company and its subsidiaries.  Investments in affiliates owned 50% or
     less are accounted for by the equity method.

     ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
     and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
     statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from
     those estimates.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
     The functional currency of substantially all operations outside the
     U.S. is the respective local currency, except for hyperinflationary
     countries where it is the U.S. Dollar.

     ADVERTISING COSTS
     Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed
     when the commercials are initially aired.  Advertising expenses
     included in costs of Company-operated restaurants and general,
     administrative and selling expenses were (in millions):  1996 -
     $503.3; 1995 - $431.0; 1994 - $385.6.

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
     The Company accounts for stock options as prescribed by APB Opinion
     No. 25 and included pro forma information in the Stock options
     footnote, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
     No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123).

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and
     amortization provided on the straight-line method over the following
     estimated useful lives:  buildings - up to 40 years; leasehold
     improvements - lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms
     including option periods; and equipment - three to 12 years.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangible assets, primarily franchise rights reacquired from
     franchisees and affiliates, are amortized on the straight-line method
     over an average life of about 30 years.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 37
     ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
     In the first quarter 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
     Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of (SFAS 121).
     This statement requires impairment losses be recognized for long-lived
     assets, whether these assets are held for disposal or continue to be
     used in operations, when indicators of impairment are present and the
     fair value of assets are estimated to be less than carrying amounts.
     The fair value of assets was based on projected future cash flows.
     The adoption of this standard in 1996 resulted in a $16 million pre-
     tax charge to operating income, equivalent to 2 cents per common
     share, related to restaurant sites in Mexico.

     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The Company uses derivatives to manage risk, but not for trading
     purposes.  Non-U.S. Dollar financing transactions generally are
     effective as hedges of either long-term investments in or intercompany
     loans to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  Foreign currency gains
     and losses on hedges of long-term investments are recorded in
     shareholders' equity as foreign currency translation adjustments.
     Gains and losses related to hedges of intercompany loans offset the
     gains and losses on intercompany loans and are recorded in
     nonoperating income (expense)-net.
       Interest-rate exchange agreements are designated and effective to
     modify the Company's interest-rate exposures.  Net interest is accrued
     as either interest receivable or payable with the offset recorded in
     interest expense.  Gains or losses from the early termination of
     interest-rate swaps are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense
     over the shorter of the remaining life of the swap or the underlying
     debt being hedged.
       The Company purchases foreign currency options (with little or no
     initial intrinsic value) to hedge anticipated foreign currency royalty
     and other payments received in the U.S.  The premiums paid for these
     options are amortized over the option life and are recorded as
     nonoperating expense.  Any realized gains on exercised options are
     deferred and recognized as nonoperating income in the period in which
     the related royalty or other payment is received.
       Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to
     mitigate exposure on foreign currency cash flows received from
     affiliates and subsidiaries.  These contracts are marked to market
     with the resulting gains or losses recorded in nonoperating income
     (expense)-net.  Gains and losses associated with these forward
     contracts have not been material.
       If a hedged item matures or is extinguished, or if a hedged
     anticipated royalty or other payment is no longer probable, the
     associated derivative is marked to market with the resulting gain or
     loss recognized immediately.  The derivative is then redesignated as a
     hedge of some other item or terminated.

     STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
     The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments to be cash
     equivalents.  The impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash and
     equivalents was not material.<PAGE>

     SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company operates exclusively in the foodservice industry.
     Substantially all revenues result from the sale of menu products at
     restaurants operated by the Company, franchisees or affiliates.
     Operating income includes the Company's share of operating results of
     affiliates.  All intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in
     computing revenues and operating income.  Fees received from
     subsidiaries outside the U.S. were (in millions): 1996-$419.0; 1995-
     $358.4; 1994-$268.9.
       The corporate component of operating income represents corporate
     general, administrative and selling expenses.  Corporate assets
     include corporate cash, investments, asset portions of financing
     instruments and certain intangibles.

     Net losses from property dispositions in 1996 included the $16.0
     million charge for restaurant sites in Mexico, upon the adoption of
     SFAS 121.
       A special charge of $72.0 million was recorded in 1996 related
     primarily to plans to strengthen the U.S. business and reduce ongoing
     costs by closing approximately 115 low-volume U.S. satellite
     restaurants, replacing certain restaurant equipment, outsourcing
     excess property management and implementing other cost efficiencies.

     PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company's program for U.S. employees includes profit sharing,
     401(k)  (McDESOP) and leveraged employee stock ownership (LESOP)
     features.  McDESOP allows participants to make contributions which are
     partly matched by the Company.  Profit sharing assets and
     contributions made by McDESOP participants can be invested in
     McDonald's common stock or among several other investment
     alternatives.  Company contributions to McDESOP are invested in
     McDonald's common stock.  Due to the conversion of all remaining
     preferred shares in 1995, the LESOP is now invested only in McDonald's
     common stock.
       Executives, staff and restaurant managers participate in profit
     sharing contributions and shares released under the LESOP, based on
     participant's compensation.  The profit sharing contribution is
     discretionary, and the Company determines the amount each year.  The
     LESOP contribution is based on the loan payments necessary to amortize
     the debt incurred to acquire the stock.  Shares held by the LESOP are
     allocated to participants as the loan is repaid.  Dividends on shares
     held by the LESOP are used to service the debt, and shares are
     released to participants to replace the dividends on shares that have
     been allocated to them.  LESOP costs shown in the following table were
     based upon the cash paid for loan payments less these dividends.<PAGE>

       Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been provided on basis differences
     related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.
     These basis differences were approximately $1.4 billion at December 31,
     1996, and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered
     permanently invested in the businesses.  The tax liability, if any, on
     these undistributed earnings depends on circumstances existing when
     remittance occurs.  Since the Company does not anticipate distributing
     these earnings in the foreseeable future, it is not practicable to
     determine the amount of tax liability, if any, if these earnings were
     not considered permanently invested.<PAGE>

     At December 31, 1996, the Company was lessee at 3,513 locations
     through ground leases (the Company leases land and owns buildings) and
     at 4,862 locations through improved leases (the Company leases land
     and buildings).  Lease terms for most restaurants are generally for 20
     to 25 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and
     renewal options with certain leases providing purchase options.  For
     most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy
     costs which include property taxes, insurance and maintenance.  In
     addition, the Company is lessee under noncancelable leases covering
     offices and vehicles.
       Future minimum payments required under operating leases with
     initial terms of one year or more are:

     Franchise arrangements include a lease and a license and generally
     provide for initial fees, as well as continuing rent and service fee
     payments to the Company, based upon a percent of sales with minimum
     rent payments.  Franchisees are granted the right to operate a
     McDonald's restaurant using the McDonald's system as well as the use
     of a restaurant facility generally for a period of 20 years.
     Franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes,
     insurance, maintenance and a refundable, noninterest-bearing security
     deposit.  The results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased
     and sold in transactions with franchisees and affiliates were not
     material to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to
     purchase and sale.

     DEBT FINANCING
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
     The Company has a line of credit agreement for $675.0 million with
     various banks which expires on April 19, 2001.  Accordingly, $675.0
     million of notes maturing within one year have been reclassified as
     long-term debt.  Fees are .06% per annum on the total commitment.  The
     Company has an additional $25.0 million line of credit agreement with
     various banks with a renewable term of 364 days and fees of .07% per
     annum on the total commitment.  Both agreements remained unused at
     December 31, 1996.  Borrowings under the agreements bear interest at
     one of several specified floating rates selected by the Company at the
     time of borrowing. In addition, certain subsidiaries outside the U.S.
     had unused lines of credit totaling $454.2 million at December 31,
     1996; these were principally short-term and denominated in various
     currencies at local market rates of interest.  The weighted-average
     interest rate of short-term borrowings, composed of commercial paper
     and foreign currency bank line borrowings, was 6.4% at December 31,
     1996, and 1995.

     EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS
     The Company has entered into agreements for the exchange of various
     currencies, certain of which also provide for the periodic exchange of
     interest payments.  These agreements, and other interest-rate exchange
     agreements, expire through 2008.  Such currency exchange agreements
     had a notional amount equivalent to U.S. $2.6 billion at December 31,
     1996, and related primarily to the exchange of French Francs, Deutsche
     Marks and Swiss Francs.  The notional principal is the amount used to
     calculate interest payments which are exchanged over the life of the
     swap transaction and is equal to the amount of foreign currency or
     U.S. Dollar principal exchanged at maturity.  The interest-rate
     exchange agreements (primarily U.S. Dollars, British Pounds Sterling
     and Deutsche Marks) had a notional amount equivalent to U.S.
     $1.9 billion at December 31, 1996.  The net value of each exchange
     agreement based on its current spot rate was classified as an asset or
     liability, and any related interest income was netted against interest
     expense.
       The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group
     of financial institutions.  The Company continually monitors its
     positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and adjusts
     positions as appropriate.  The Company does not have significant
     exposure to any individual counterparty and has entered into master
     agreements that contain netting arrangements.
       At December 31, 1996, the Company had purchased foreign currency
     options outstanding (primarily British Pounds Sterling, Deutsche Marks
     and Swiss Francs) with a notional amount equivalent to U.S. $180.9
     million.  The unamortized premium related to these currency options
     was $2.8 million and there were no related deferred gains recorded as
     of year end.  Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts
     outstanding at December 31, 1996 (primarily Deutsche Marks, Japanese
     Yen and Swiss Francs) had a U.S. Dollar equivalent of $33.7 million.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 47
     GUARANTEES
     The Company has guaranteed and included in total debt at December 31,
     1996, $133.0 million of 7.4% ESOP Notes Series A and $70.6 million of
     7.1% ESOP Notes Series B issued by the Leveraged Employee Stock
     Ownership Plan with payments through 2004 and 2006, respectively.  The
     Company has agreed to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of
     certain events. The Company also has guaranteed certain affiliate
     loans totaling $138.6 million at December 31, 1996.

     The carrying amounts for cash and equivalents and notes receivable
     approximated fair value.  No fair value was provided for noninterest-
     bearing security deposits by franchisees as these deposits are an
     integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.
       Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts were recorded at
     their fair value of $33.7 million at December 31, 1996.  The fair
     value of the debt and notes payable obligations (excluding capital
     leases), the currency and interest-rate exchange agreements and the
     foreign currency options was estimated using quoted market prices,
     various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses.  The Company
     has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior
     to maturity.  Given the market value of its common stock and its
     significant real estate holdings, the Company believes that the fair
     value of total assets was higher than their carrying value at
     December 31, 1996.

     DEBT OBLIGATIONS
     The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public
     and private offerings and bank loans.  The terms of most debt
     obligations contain restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages
     and long-term debt of certain subsidiaries.  Under certain agreements,
     the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at
     par or at a premium over par.  The following table summarizes these
     debt obligations, including the gross effects of currency and
     interest-rate exchange agreements.<PAGE>

     STOCK OPTIONS
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1996, the Company had three stock-based compensation
     plans, two for employees and one for non-employee directors, accounted
     for under APB Opinion No. 25.  Options to purchase common stock are
     granted at prices not less than the fair market value of the stock on
     date of grant. Therefore, no compensation cost has been recognized in
     the consolidated financial statements for these plans.
       Substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal
     installments, every two years, beginning a year from the date of the
     grant, and expiring 10 years from the grant date.  At December 31,
     1996, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
     the two employee plans was 97.3 million, including 24.6 million
     available for future grants.
       A summary of the status of the Company's plans as of December 31,
     1996, 1995 and 1994, and changes during the years ending on those
     dates is presented below:

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Options granted each year were about 2% of average common shares
     outstanding for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, representing grants
     to approximately 10,300, 8,500 and 7,700 employees in those three
     years.  When stock options are exercised, shares are issued from
     treasury stock.
       Pro forma net income and net income per common share in the table
     below was determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee
     stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        1996      1995

     Weighted-average fair value of options granted    16.88     13.07
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------<PAGE>

     PAGE 50
       For the pro forma disclosures, the options' estimated fair value
     was amortized over their expected seven-year life.  These pro forma
     amounts are not indicative of anticipated future disclosures because
     SFAS 123 does not apply to grants before 1995.  Therefore, the pro
     forma disclosures do not include a full seven years of grants.  The
     fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using
     an option pricing model which was designed to estimate the fair value
     of options which, unlike employee stock options, can be traded at any
     time and are fully transferable.  In addition, such models require the
     input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
     volatility of the stock price.  Therefore, in management's opinion,
     the existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the
     value of employee stock options.  The following weighted-average
     assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of these options.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       The following table shows the potential dilution of common shares
     outstanding from stock option exercises, assuming all options
     outstanding and in-the-money at year end are exercised.  The
     calculation assumes that shares issued upon exercise are partly offset
     by shares purchased with proceeds from the exercise, based on the
     December 31 price of the Company's common stock each year.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  1996        1995        1994

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       As shown above, the average option exercise price has consistently
     exceeded the average cost of treasury stock issued for option
     exercises.  This is because the Company prefunds the program through
     share repurchase.  Thus, stock option exercises have generated
     additional capital, since cash received from employees has exceeded
     the Company's average acquisition cost of treasury stock.  In
     addition, stock option exercises have generated $148.9 million of tax
     benefits for the Company during the three years ended December 31,
     1996.<PAGE>

     CAPITAL STOCK
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION
     Income used in the computation of per common share information was
     reduced by preferred stock cash dividends (net of tax benefits).  In
     1995, income was also reduced by $3.9 million for the one-time effect
     of the Company's exchange of its Series E 7.72% Cumulative Preferred
     Stock for subordinated debt securities, and by an additional $.4
     million for the effect of the Company's repurchase of additional
     Series E preferred stock.  Adjusted net income was divided by the
     weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during each year
     (in millions):  1996 - 698.2; 1995 - 701.5; 1994 - 701.8.  Including
     the effect of potentially dilutive securities, fully diluted earnings
     per common share amounts and increases were: 1996 - $2.16, 13%; 1995 -
     $1.92, 18%; 1994 - $1.63, 16%.

     PREFERRED STOCK
     In December 1992, the Company issued $500.0 million of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $50,000
     per share.  One preferred share is equal to 2,000 depository shares.
     Each preferred share is entitled to one vote under certain
     circumstances, and is redeemable at the option of the Company
     beginning on December 3, 1997, at its liquidation value plus accrued
     dividends.  In 1995, the Company completed an exchange of depositary
     shares equalling 2,600 shares of this preferred stock for subordinated
     debt securities and repurchased depositary shares equalling
     approximately 250 shares.
       In September 1989 and April 1991, respectively, the Company sold
     $200.0 million of Series B and $100.0 million of Series C ESOP
     Convertible Preferred Stock to the LESOP.  The LESOP financed the
     purchase by issuing notes guaranteed by the Company and included in
     long-term debt, with an offsetting reduction in shareholders' equity.
     Each preferred share had a liquidation preference of $14.375 and
     $16.5625, respectively, and was convertible to a minimum of .7692 and
     .8 common share (conversion rate), respectively.  Upon termination of
     employment, employees were guaranteed a minimum value payable in
     common shares equal to the greater of the conversion rate; the fair
     market value of their preferred shares; or the liquidation preference
     plus accrued dividends, not to exceed one common share. Each preferred
     share was entitled to one vote and was redeemable at the option of the
     Company.  In 1992, 8.2 million Series B shares were converted into 6.4
     million common shares.  During 1995, the remaining 5.2 million Series
     B shares and 5.8 million Series C shares were converted into 8.7
     million common shares.<PAGE>

     PAGE 53
     CHANGE IN PAR VALUE
     In May 1996, Company shareholders approved an increase in the number
     of authorized shares of Common Stock from 1.25 billion with no par
     value to 3.5 billion with $.01 par value.  The change in par value did
     not affect any of the existing rights of shareholders and has been
     recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital and common
     stock.

     SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
     In December 1988, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred
     Share Purchase Right (Right) on each outstanding share of common
     stock.  Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to
     purchase one four-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
     Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $62.50 (which
     may be adjusted under certain circumstances).  The Right is
     transferable apart from the common stock 10 days following a public
     announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership
     of 20% or more of the outstanding common shares, or 10 business days
     following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a
     tender or exchange offer resulting in beneficial ownership by a person
     or group exceeding the threshold.  The threshold may be reduced by the
     Board of Directors to as low as 10%.
       Once the threshold has been exceeded, or if the Company is acquired
     in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Right will
     entitle the holder, other than such person or group, to purchase at
     the then current exercise price, stock of the Company or the acquiring
     company having a market value of twice the exercise price.
       Each Right is nonvoting and expires on December 28, 1998, unless
     redeemed by the Company, at a price of $.0025, at any time prior to
     the public announcement that a person or group has exceeded the
     threshold.  At December 31, 1996, 2.1 million shares of the Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance under
     this plan.<PAGE>

     Comments appearing in this annual report. The financial statements
     were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
     principles and include certain amounts based on management's judgment
     and best estimates. Other financial information presented in the
     annual report is consistent with the financial statements.
       The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
     reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized
     acquisition, use or disposition, which is designed to provide
     reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of
     Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial
     statements and such asset safeguarding. The system includes a
     documented organizational structure and appropriate division of
     responsibilities; established policies and procedures which are
     communicated throughout the Company; careful selection, training, and
     development of our people; and utilization of an internal audit
     program. Policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all
     employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and that
     business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a
     manner which is above reproach.
       There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system
     of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the
     circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
     effective internal control system can provide only reasonable
     assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
     safeguarding of assets. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal
     control system can change with circumstances. The Company believes
     that at December 31, 1996, it maintained an effective system of
     internal control over financial reporting and safeguarding of assets
     against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.
       The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
     independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, who were given unrestricted
     access to all financial records and related data. The audit report of
     Ernst & Young LLP is presented below.
       The Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee
     composed entirely of independent Directors, provides oversight to the
     financial reporting process. Ernst & Young LLP has independent access
     to the Audit Committee and periodically meets with the Committee to
     discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Board of Directors and Shareholders
     McDonald's Corporation
     Oak Brook, Illinois

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
     McDonald's Corporation as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
     related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
     cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
     31, 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of
     McDonald's Corporation management. Our responsibility is to express an
     opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
     the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.
       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
     of McDonald's Corporation at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
     consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
     the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity
     with generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                                EXHIBIT 10F

                           McDONALD'S CORPORATION
                            DEFERRED INCOME PLAN
          (As Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 1997)


                                  Section 1
                                Introduction

       1.1  The Plan and Effective Date.  The McDonald's Corporation
  Deferred Income Plan, formerly known as the McDonald's Corporation
  Deferred Incentive Plan, ("Plan") was established November 1, 1993.  The
  Plan was amended and restated effective September 1, 1994 and was
  subsequently amended by the first amendment thereof effective as of
  February 1, 1996 and the second amendment thereof effective as of August
  15, 1996 (the "previous Plan document").  The "effective date" of the
  amendment and restatement of the Plan as set forth herein is January 1,
  1997 and applies to deferral elections made by Participants with respect
  to amount which would otherwise be paid in 1997.  Amounts deferred prior
  to September 1, 1996 will continue to be credited with rates of return in
  accordance with the terms of the previous Plan document until January 1,
  1997.

       1.2  Purpose.  McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's" or the
  "Company") has established the Plan for its officers, regional managers,
  and certain expatriate international country heads to retain and attract
  highly qualified personnel by offering the benefits of a non-qualified,
  unfunded plan of deferred compensation.  The Company may also allow other
  subsidiaries or affiliates to adopt the Plan in accordance with Section 7.

       1.3  Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by the
  Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
  "Committee").  The Committee shall have the powers set forth in the Plan
  and the power to interpret its provisions.  Any decisions of the
  Committee shall be final and binding on all persons with regard to the
  Plan.  The Committee may delegate its authority hereunder to an officer
  or officers of the Company.


                                  Section 2
                    Participation and Deferral Elections

       2.1  Eligibility and Participation.   Subject to the conditions and
  limitations of the Plan, all officers and regional managers of the
  Company and international country heads who are on United States payroll
  and who are identified as eligible by the Committee shall be eligible to
  participate in the Plan ("Eligible Employees").  Any Eligible Employee
  who makes a Deferral Election as described in Section 2.2 below shall
  become a participant in the Plan ("Participant") and shall remain a
  Participant until the entire balance of the Participant's Deferral
  Accounts (defined in Section 4.1 below) is distributed.

       2.2  Deferral Elections.  Any Eligible Employee may make a Deferral
  Election to defer receipt of all or any portion of his or her incentive
  under the McDonald's Target Incentive Plan ("TIP") for a calendar year.
  Any Eligible Employee may also make an election to defer up to 50% of his
  or her base salary for the following calendar year.  Any Eligible
  Employee who is one of the five highest compensated officers of the
  Company (ranked by the total of base pay and the target incentive under
  TIP for the current year) may also elect to defer up to 90% of his or her
  base salary for the following calendar year.

       2.3  Rules for Deferral Elections.  Deferral Elections shall be made
  in accordance with the rules set forth below:

       (a)  All Deferral Elections must be in writing on such forms as the
            Committee may prescribe and must be returned to the Committee
            no later than the date specified by the Committee.  In no event
            will the return date specified by the Committee be later than
            the end of the year that precedes the year that the amount
            deferred would otherwise be made available to such Eligible
            Employee.

       (b)  An individual shall be eligible to make a Deferral Election
            only if he or she is an Eligible Employee on the date specified
            by the Committee for the return of Deferral Election forms.

       (c)  If an Eligible Employee terminates employment in the same
            calendar year in which he or she makes a Deferral Election,
            that Deferral Election will be null and void and no deferral
            will be made.

       (d)  Amounts will be deferred to the "Payment Date" specified by the
            Eligible Employee in the Deferral Election and payments will
            commence within 30 days following the Payment Date in
            accordance with Section 5.1.  The Payment Date specified must
            be no earlier than the March 31st of the calendar year
            following the year in which the deferred amounts would
            otherwise have been paid and must be either:

            (i)  The 15th or last day of a specified month (but not
                 December 31) of a specified year in the future (the
                 "Specific Year Payment Date") or

            (ii) the March 31 following the year in which the Participant
                 terminates employment (the "Employment Termination Payment
                 Date").

            If a Participant terminates employment and has one or more
            Specific Year Payment Dates that would occur after the
            Employment Termination Payment Date, all amounts deferred to
            those Specific Year Payment Date(s) shall automatically be
            accelerated and payment with commence on the Employment
            Termination Payment Date.  Participant McDESOP Equalization
            Amounts and Company Profit Sharing Equalization Credits
            described in Section 3 shall be deferred to the Participant's
            Employment Termination Payment Date, even though a Participant
            has elected a Specific Year Payment Date for the remainder of
            his or her deferral.

            Deferral elections made prior to September 1, 1996 shall be
            deferred to the date specified in the deferral election in
            accordance with the terms of the Plan prior to January 1, 1997.


                                  Section 3
       Equalization for McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program

       3.1  Equalization to Adjust for Participant 401(k) McDESOP
  Contributions.  Amounts deferred under this Plan are not considered
  compensation for the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program (the
  "Profit Sharing Program") or for the related non-qualified plans:   the
  McDonald's 1989 Executive Compensation Plan, the McDonald's Supplemental
  Employee Benefit Equalization Plan and the McDonald's Profit Sharing
  Program Equalization Plan (the "McCAP/McEqual Plans").  The McDESOP
  portion of the Profit Sharing Program allows participants to contribute a 
  percentage of their compensation as Section 401(k) contributions.
  Therefore, Eligible Employees who are Profit Sharing Program participants
  and make Deferral Elections under this Plan shall automatically have a
  portion of the amount deferred set aside until the Participant's
  Termination Payment Date to adjust for the fact McDESOP Section 401(k)
  contributions cannot be made to the Profit Sharing Program or the related
  non-qualified plans for deferred amounts (the "Participant McDESOP
  Equalization Amount").  The Participant McDESOP Equalization Amount shall
  be based on the amount that would have been contributed by the
  Participant under the McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program and
  the related non-qualified plans if the deferral had not occurred.

       3.2  Company Profit Sharing Equalization Credits.  Amounts deferred
  under this Plan are not considered aas compensation under the Profit
  Sharing McEqual Plans.  Therefore, amounts deferred under this Plan shall
  be credited with an amount equal to the Company contribution that the
  Participant would have received under the Profit Sharing Program and/or
  McCAP/McEqual Plans if such deferral had not occurred ("Company Profit
  Sharing Equalization Credit").  If a Participant is not eligible to
  participate in the Profit Sharing Program or McCAP/McEqual Plans, or is
  not eligible to receive a Company contribution under such plans with
  respect to a deferred amount, no Company Profit Sharing Equalization
  Credit will be made.

       3.3  Rules for Profit Sharing Equalization Amounts.  Equalization
  amounts under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above (collectively referred to as
  "Equalization Amounts") shall be deferred until the Participant's
  Employment Termination Payment Date and cannot be withdrawn under Section
  5.3.  Equalization Amounts will become part of the Participant's Deferral
  Account and will be credited with earnings as part of that Deferral
  Account as described in Section 4.1.


                                  Section 4
                              Deferral Accounts

       4.1  Deferral Accounts.  A bookkeeping account shall be established
  in the Participant's name ("Deferral Account").  Each Participant's
  deferral account may be further divided into:

       (a)  amounts deferred pursuant to that year's Deferral Election and
            earnings thereon,

       (b)  Company Profit Sharing Equalization Credits associated with
            that year's Deferral Election and earnings thereon; and

       (c)  Participant 401(k) McDESOP Equalization amounts associated with
            that year's Deferral Election and earnings thereon.

  The Committee may also authorize other divisions or subaccounts of the
  deferral accounts as may be necessary to reflect the terms of the plan as
  amended from time to time.

  Amounts deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election shall be credited to the
  Deferral Account as of the date the Participant would otherwise have
  received the deferred amounts in the absence of a Deferral Election.  Any
  Equalization Amounts shall be credited to the Deferral Account as of the
  date the amount would have been allocated under the Profit Sharing
  Program or the McCAP/McEqual Plans if the deferral had not occurred.

       4.2  Investment Elections and Earnings Credits.  Prior to January 1,
  1997, amounts deferred under the Plan shall continue to be credited with
  the rate of return under the investment options and procedures set forth
  in the Plan as in effect prior to that date.  Effective on and after 
  January 1, 1997, each Participant in the Plan shall make an investment
  election, as described below, and such election shall apply to the entire
  amount credited to the Participant's Deferral Accounts under the Plan.
  However, Section 16 Insiders, as defined in Section 5.5 of the Plan may
  not make investment elections involving McDonald's Common Stock.  (For
  further details concerning these restrictions, see Section 5.5 of the
  Plan.)  Participants who terminated employment prior to January 1, 1997,
  may file a new investment election in accordance with the provisions of
  this Section 4.2 effective on and after January 1, 1997, but if no new
  investment election is filed, Deferral Accounts for these participants
  will continue to be invested in accordance with the investment elections
  made prior to January 1, 1997.

  A Participant may change his investment election effective as of the
  first day of any month up to a maximum of four such investment elections
  each calendar year.  All investment elections shall be made by filing an
  investment election form with the Committee at such time and in such
  manner as the Committee may specify.

  Investment elections may be split between the following equivalent rates
  of return in increments of 10%, provided that the percentages specified
  must total 100%.

       (a)  a rate of return based upon the McDonald's Common Stock Fund
            under the Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for expenses
            ("McDonald's Common Stock" equivalent);

       (b)  a rate of return based upon the Insurance Contract Fund under
            the Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for expenses
            ("Insurance Contract" equivalent);

       (c)  a rate of return based upon the Diversified Stock Fund under
            the Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for expenses
            ("Diversified Stock" equivalent);

       (d)  a rate of return based upon the Multi-Asset Fund under the
            Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for expenses ("Multi-
            Asset" equivalent); and

       (e)  a rate of return based upon the Money Market Fund under the
            Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for expenses ("Money
            Market" equivalent).

  If a Participant who is employed fails to make an investment election,
  amounts shall be credited with the same rate of return as amounts for
  which no investment election is received under the Profit Sharing
  component of the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program.
  (Currently, this is the Money Market equivalent rate of return.)   All
  investment elections will continue in effect for all Participants until
  the Participant files a new investment election.

  As of the 15th day (or if the fifteenth day of the month is not a
  business day, the next previous business day) and the last business day
  of each calendar month, or such additional dates as the Committee shall
  specify ("Valuation Date"), each Deferral Account shall be credited with
  earnings, gains and losses equal to the amount the Deferral Account would
  have earned, gained or lost, since the prior Valuation Date.

       4.3  Vesting.  A Participant shall be fully vested at all times in
  the balance of his or her Deferral Account.


                                  Section 5
                             Payment of Benefits

       5.1  Time and Method of Payment.  Payments to a Participant, or the
  Participant's beneficiary if the Participant is deceased, shall
  automatically be paid in a lump sum within 30 days following the Payment
  Date, unless the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary files a
  written installment distribution election on or before December 31 of the
  calendar year preceding the Payment Date.  An installment distribution
  election shall apply to all payments for that Payment Date and shall
  specify the period of years (up to a maximum of 15 years) over which
  payments are to be made and shall also specify whether installments are
  to be made quarterly or annually.  Installment payments shall be made in
  substantially equal installments over the installment period specified
  and shall commence within 30 days after the Payment Date.  Each
  installment payment shall be computed by dividing the balance of the
  Deferral Account(s) that is to be paid in installments by the number of
  payments remaining in the installment period.  Once an installment
  election is filed for a Payment Date, it cannot be revoked.  However,
  because the method of payment described above is more flexible, Deferral
  Elections made in 1993 which specified a five year installment payment
  shall be null and void, and shall be paid in a lump sum, unless the
  Participant or the Participant's beneficiary files a written installment
  election prior to December 31 of the calendar year preceding the Payment
  Date.

       5.2  Form of Payment.  All payments shall be made in cash.  However,
  a Participant  who has eleted a McDonald's Common Stock based return may
  elect to receive payment in the form of shares of McDonald's Common Stock
  by filing a written request with the Committee prior to December 31 of
  the calendar year preceding the Payment Date.

       5.3  Early Withdrawals and Acceleration of Installment Payments.  A
  Participant shall have the right to withdraw in cash any portion of the
  balance of his or her Deferral Accounts (except for the Equalization
  Amounts of the Participant's Deferral Accounts under Sections 4.1(b) and
  (c) and amounts which were not withdrawable under the terms of the Plan
  prior to September 1, 1994) at any time prior to the applicable Payment
  Date, subject to the Committee's consent and a 10% forfeiture penalty on
  the amount requested.  A Participant who is receiving installment
  payments may accelerate payment of any unpaid amount, subject to the
  Committee's consent and 10% forfeiture penalty on the amount accelerated.
  The withdrawal or accelerated installment (reduced by the 10% forfeiture
  penalty) shall be paid within 30 days of the Valuation Date next
  following the date the election to withdraw or accelerate payments is
  approved by the Committee.  Withdrawals and accelerated installments
  shall be made first from the earliest maturing Deferral Account and shall
  be taken pro rata from the investment rate equivalents elected by the
  Participant.  Withdrawals shall be subject to such procedures as the
  Committee shall establish from time to time.

       5.4  Withholding of Taxes.  The Company shall withhold any
  applicable Federal, state or local income tax from payments due under the
  Plan in accordance with such procedures as the Company may establish.
  Generally, any Social Security taxes, including the Medicare portion of
  such taxes, shall be withheld and paid at the time incentive payments
  under the Target Incentive Plan or base salary payments would otherwise
  have been paid to the Participant.  The Company shall also withhold any
  other employment taxes as necessary to comply with applicable laws.

       5.5  Limitations For Section 16 Insiders.  A  "Section 16 Insider"
  shall include any Participant who has been deemed to be subject to
  Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") by
  the Board of Directors of the Company.  Notwithstanding any provision of
  the Plan to the contrary, the Deferral Account of each Section 16 Insider
  is subject to the following limitations: 

       (a)  An Eligible Employee who is a Section 16 Insider at the time he
            or she makes a Deferral Election may elect a McDonald's Common
            Stock based return and at the same time must also specify the
            Payment Date and whether the payment will be in a lump sum or
            the specific installment period that will apply.  The election
            of a McDonald's Common Stock based return is irrevocable and
            cannot be changed by an investment election at a later date.  A
            Participant who is a Section 16 Insider may not make a
            withdrawal or accelerate installments under Section 5.3 of any
            Deferral Account(s) that are credited with a McDonald's Common
            Stock based return.  Section 16 Insiders who elect a McDonald's
            Common Stock based return and a form of payment will not be
            able to change those elections, even if the Plan is amended at
            a later date to provide increased flexibility.

       (b)  A Section 16 Insider who elects to invest in McDonald's Common
            Stock based return shall also elect, at the time the deferral
            is made, whether the distribution will be paid in cash or in
            the form of McDonald's Common Stock.  This provision applies
            only to deferral elections made on and after August 15, 1996.
            Amounts deferred under all deferral elections made prior to
            August 15, 1996 will be paid in cash.  However, for these cash
            distributions only, to the extent that a Section 16 Insider
            uses the cash distribution to purchase shares of McDonald's
            Common Stock on the open market in one or more transactions
            within seven months after the date such amounts are
            distributed, the Company shall reimburse the Section 16 Insider
            for all reasonable brokerage fees and other transaction costs
            incurred in connection with such purchases upon presentation of
            satisfactory evidence thereof not later than 60 days after the
            date of each transaction.

       (c)  If any Participant becomes a Section 16 Insider after making a
            Deferral Election under the Plan, any Deferral Account that is
            being credited with a McDonald's Common Stock based return
            shall automatically be converted to any non-McDonald's Common
            Stock based investment return specified by the Participant on
            an investment election form as of the Valuation Date
            immediately preceding the date the Participant is designated a
            Section 16 Insider by the Board of Directors.  This automatic
            change to non-McDonald's Common Stock based returns will be
            made to preserve the Participant's right to make investment
            choices for investment options that do not involve McDonald's
            Common Stock, make early withdrawals and elect accelerated
            installments under Section 5.3.

       (d)  Elections to invest in McDonald's Common Stock based returns
            can be made by Section 16 Insiders only at the time the
            deferral election is made.  Investment elections which would
            result in a transfer into the McDonald's Common Stock based
            return at a later date are not permitted for Section 16
            Insiders.

  In addition, the Committee may take such other actions as are necessary
  so that transactions by Section 16 Insiders do not result in liability
  under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

       5.6  Beneficiary.  A Participant shall have the right to name a
  beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall receive the balance of a
  Participant's Deferral Account in the event of the Participant's death
  prior to the payment of his or her entire Deferral Account.  If no
  beneficiary is named by a Participant or if he or she survives all of the
  named beneficiaries, the Deferral Account shall be paid to the same 
  beneficiary or beneficiaries to which the Deferral Account would have
  been paid if it were in the Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account
  under the Profit Sharing Program as of the date of the Participant's
  death.  To be effective, any beneficiary designation shall be filed in
  writing with the Committee.  A Participant may revoke an existing
  beneficiary designation by filing another written beneficiary designation
  with the Committee.  The latest beneficiary designation received by the
  Committee shall be controlling.


                                  Section 6
                                Miscellaneous

       6.1  Funding.  Benefits payable under the Plan to any Participant
  shall be paid directly by the Company.  The Company shall not be required
  to fund, or otherwise segregate assets to be used for payment of benefits
  under the Plan.  While the Company may, in the discretion of the
  Committee, make investments (a) in shares of McDonald's Common Stock
  through open market purchases or (b) in other investments in amounts
  equal or unequal to amounts payable hereunder, the Company shall not be
  under any obligation to make such investments and any such investment
  shallll  rremain an asset of the Company subject to the claims of its general
  creeditors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may maaiintain one
  or more trusts ("Trust") to hold assets to be used for payment of
  benefits under the Plan.  Any payments by a Trust of benefits provided to
  a Participant under the Plan shall be considered payment by the Company
  and shall discharge the Company of any further liability under the Plan
  for such payments.

       6.2  Account  Statements.  The Company shall provide Participants
  with statements of the balance of their Deferral Accounts under the Plan
  at least annually.  The Committee may, in their discretion, also issue
  statements as of the March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31
  Valuation Dates.

       6.3  Employment Rights.  Establishment of the Plan shall not be
  construed to give any Eligible Employee the right to be retained in the
  Company's service or to any benefits not specifically provided by the
  Plan.

       6.4  Interests Not Transferable.  Except as to withholding of any
  tax under the laws of the United States or any state or locality and the
  provisions of Section 5.6, no benefit payable at any time under the Plan
  shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
  pledge, attachment, or other legal process, or encumbrance of any kind.
  Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise
  encumber any such benefits, whether currently or thereafter payable,
  shall be void.  No person shall, in any manner, be liable for or subject
  to the debts or liabilities of any person entitled to such benefits.  If
  any person shall attempt to, or shall alienate, sell, transfer, assign,
  pledge or otherwise encumber benefits under the Plan, or if by any reason
  of the Participant's bankruptcy or other event happening at any time,
  such benefits would devolve upon any other person or would not be enjoyed
  by the person entitled thereto under the Plan, then the Company, in its
  discretion, may terminate the interest in any such benefits of the person
  entitled thereto under the Plan and hold or apply them to or for the
  benefit of such person entitled thereto under the Plan or such
  individual's spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them, in
  such manner as the Company may deem proper.

       6.5  Forfeitures and Unclaimed Amounts.  Unclaimed amounts shall
  consist of the amounts of the Deferral Accounts of a Participant that
  cannot be distributed because of the Committee's inability, after a
  reasonable search, to locate a Participant or the Participant's
  beneficiary, as applicable, within a period of two (2) years after the
  Payment Date upon which the payment of benefits become due. Unclaimed
  amounts shall be forfeited at the end of such two-year period.  Penalties
  charged for withdrawals under Section 5.3 shall also be forfeited in the
  year in which the penalty is charged.  These forfeitures will reduce the
  obligations of the Company under the Plan.  After an unclaimed amount has
  been forfeited, the Participant or beneficiary, as applicable, shall have
  no further right to the Participant's Deferral Account.

       6.6  Controlling Law.  The law of Illinois, except its law with
  respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all matters relating to
  the Plan to the extent not preempted by ERISA.

       6.7  Action by the Company.  Except as otherwise specifically
  provided herein, any action required of or permitted by the Company under
  the Plan shall be by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company
  or by action of any member of the Committee or person(s) authorized by
  resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company.


                                  Section 7
                           Employer Participation

       7.1  Adoption of Plan.  Any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company
  ("Employer") may, with the approval of the Committee and under such terms
  and conditions as the Committee may prescribe, adopt the corresponding
  portions of the Plan by resolution of its board of directors.  The
  Committee may amend the Plan as necessary or desirable to reflect the
  adoption of the Plan by an Employer, provided however, that an adopting
  Employer shall not have the authority to amend or terminate the Plan
  under Section 8.

       7.2  Withdrawal from the Plan by Employer.  Any such Employer shall
  have the right, at any time, upon the approval of and under such
  conditions as may be provided by the Committee, to withdraw from the Plan
  by delivering to the Committee written notice of its election so to
  withdraw.  Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the portion of
  the Deferral Accounts of Participants and beneficiaries attributable to
  credits made while the Participants were employees of such withdrawing
  Employer, plus any net earnings, gains and losses or such credits, shall
  be distributed from the Trust at the direction of the Committee in cash
  at such time or times as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may deem
  to be in the best interest of such employees and their beneficiaries. To
  the extent the amounts held in the Trust for the benefit of such
  Participants and beneficiaries are not sufficient to satisfy the
  Employer's obligation to such Participants and their beneficiaries
  accrued on account of their employment with the Employer, the remaining
  amount necessary to satisfy such obligation shall be an obligation of the
  Employer, and the Company shall have no further obligation to such
  Participants and beneficiaries with respect to such amounts.


                                  Section 8
                          Amendment and Termination

  The Company intends the Plan to be permanent, but reserves the right at
  any time by action of its Board of Directors or by the Committee (in
  accordance with the restrictions in the following sentence) to modify,
  amend or terminate the Plan, provided however, that any amendment or
  termination of the Plan shall not reduce or eliminate any Deferral
  Account accrued through the date of such amendment or termination.
  The Committee shall have the same authority to adopt amendments to the
  Plan as the Board of Directors of the Company in the following
  circumstances:

       (a)  to adopt amendments to the Plan which the Committee determines
            are necessary or desirable for the Plan to comply with or to
            obtain benefits or advantages under the provisions of
            applicable law, regulations or rulings or requirements of the
            Internal Revenue Service or other governmental administrative
            agency or changes in such law, regulations, rulings or
            requirements; and

       (b)  to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic amendment that
            the Committee determines to be necessary or desirable that does
            not materially change benefits to Participants or their
            beneficiaries or materially increase the Company's or adopting
            Employers' credits to the Plan.

  The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by the Committee
  to the Board of Directors of the Company on a timely basis.
