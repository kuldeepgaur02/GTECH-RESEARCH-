                                     PART I

     Item 1.   Business

          McDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its
     subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company".

          (a)  General development of business

           There have been no significant changes to the Company's
     corporate structure during 1994, nor material changes in the Company's
     method of conducting business.

          (b)  Financial information about industry segments

           Industry segment data for the years ended December 31, 1994,
     1993 and 1992 is included in Part II, item 8, page 42 of this
     Form 10-K.

          (c)  Narrative description of business

          General

           The Company develops, operates, franchises and services a
     worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, assemble, package and
     sell a limited menu of value-priced foods. These restaurants are
     operated by the Company or, under the terms of franchise arrangements,
     by franchisees who are independent third parties, or by affiliates
     operating under joint-venture agreements between the Company and local
     businesspeople.

           The Company's franchising program assures consistency and
     quality.  The Company is selective in granting franchises and is not
     in the practice of franchising to investor groups or passive
     investors.  Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees
     supply capital - initially, by purchasing equipment, signs, seating,
     and decor, and over the long term, by reinvesting in the business.
     The Company shares the investment by owning or leasing the land and
     building; franchisees then contribute to the Company's revenues
     through payment of rent and service fees based upon a percent of
     sales, with specified minimum payments.  Generally, the conventional
     franchise arrangement lasts 20 years and franchising practices are
     consistent throughout the world.  Further discussion regarding site
     selection is included in Part 1, item 2, page 6 of this Form 10-K.

           Training begins at the restaurant with one-on-one instruction
     and videotapes.  Aspiring restaurant managers progress through a
     development program of classes in basic and intermediate operations,
     management and equipment.  Assistant managers are eligible to attend
     the advanced operations and management class at one of the five
     Hamburger University (H.U.) campuses in the U.S., Germany, England,
     Japan or Australia.  The curriculum at H.U. concentrates on skills and
     practices essential to delivering customer satisfaction and running a
     restaurant business.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 4
           The Company's global brand is well-known.  Marketing and
     promotional activities are designed to nurture this brand image and
     differentiate the Company from competitors by focusing on value, taste
     and customer satisfaction.  Funding for promotions is handled at the
     local restaurant level; funding for regional and national efforts is
     handled through advertising cooperatives.  Franchised, Company-
     operated and affiliated restaurants throughout the world make
     voluntary contributions to cooperatives which purchase media.
     Production costs for certain advertising efforts are borne by the
     Company.

          Products

           McDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu
     consisting of hamburgers and cheeseburgers, including the Big Mac and
     Quarter Pounder with Cheese sandwiches, the Filet-O-Fish, McGrilled
     Chicken and McChicken sandwiches, french fries, Chicken McNuggets,
     salads, shakes, sundaes and cones made with low fat frozen yogurt,
     pies, cookies and a limited number of soft drinks and other beverages.
     In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of products during limited
     promotional time periods. McDonald's restaurants operating in the
     United States are open during breakfast hours and offer a full
     breakfast menu including the Egg McMuffin and the Sausage McMuffin
     with Egg sandwiches, hotcakes and sausage; three varieties of biscuit
     sandwiches; Apple-Bran muffins; and cereals. McDonald's restaurants in
     many countries around the world offer many of these same products as
     well as other products and limited breakfast menus. The Company tests
     new products on an ongoing basis.

           The Company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food
     products and packaging from numerous independent suppliers.  Quality
     specifications for both raw and cooked food products are established
     and strictly enforced.  Alternative sources of these items are
     generally available.  Quality assurance labs in the U.S., Europe and
     the Pacific work to ensure that the Company's high standards are
     consistently met.  The quality assurance process involves ongoing
     testing and on-site inspections of suppliers' facilities.
     Independently owned and operated distribution centers distribute
     products and supplies to most McDonald's restaurants.  The restaurants
     then prepare, assemble and package these products using specially
     designed production techniques and equipment to obtain uniform
     standards of quality.

          Trademarks and patents

           The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, some
     of which, including "McDonald's", "Ronald McDonald" and other related
     marks, are of material importance to the Company's business. The
     Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while
     valuable, are not material to its business.

          Seasonal operations

           The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to
     any material degree.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 5
          Working capital practices

           Information about the Company's working capital practices is
     incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and
     Analysis of the Company's financial position and the consolidated
     statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
     and 1992 in Part II, item 7, pages 26 through 29, and Part II, item 8
     page 35 of this Form 10-K.

          Customers

           The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer
     or small group of customers.

          Backlog

           Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.

          Government contracts

           No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation
     of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election
     of the U.S. government.

          Competition

           McDonald's restaurants compete with international, national,
     regional, and local retailers of food products.  The Company competes
     on the basis of price and service and by offering quality food
     products.  The Company's competition in the broadest perspective
     includes restaurants, quick-service eating establishments, pizza
     parlors, coffee shops, street vendors, convenience food stores,
     delicatessens, and supermarket freezers.

           In the U.S., about 378,000 restaurants generate nearly $224
     billion in annual sales.  McDonald's accounts for about 2.6% of those
     restaurants and approximately 6.7% of those sales.  No reasonable
     estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside of the U.S.;
     however, the Company's business in foreign markets continues to grow.

          Research and development

           The Company operates research and development facilities in
     Illinois. While research and development activities are important to
     the Company's business, these expenditures are not material.
     Independent suppliers also conduct research activities for the benefit
     of the McDonald's System, which includes franchisees and suppliers, as
     well as McDonald's, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 6
          Environmental matters

           The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local
     environmental laws or regulations which will materially affect its
     earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital
     expenditures; however, the Company cannot predict the effect on its
     operations of possible future environmental legislation or
     regulations. During 1994, there were no material capital expenditures
     for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures
     are anticipated.

          Number of employees

           During 1994, the Company's average number of employees
     worldwide was approximately 183,000.

          (d)  Financial information about foreign and domestic operations

           Financial information about foreign and domestic markets is
     incorporated herein by reference from Selected Financial Data,
     Management's Discussion and Analysis and Segment and Geographic
     Information in Part II, item 6, page 10, Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 29 and Part II, item 8, page 42, respectively, of this Form
     10-K.

     Item 2.   Properties

           The Company identifies and develops sites that offer
     convenience to customers and provide for long-term sales and profit
     potential.  To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and
     walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant
     data.  The Company's experience and access to advanced technology aids
     in evaluating this information.  In order to control occupancy costs
     and rights, the Company owns restaurant sites and buildings where
     feasible and where it is not practical, secures long-term leases.
     Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is
     important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to lower average
     development costs through construction and design efficiencies,
     standardization and by leveraging the Company's global sourcing
     system.  Additional information about the Company's properties is
     included in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the related
     financial statements with footnotes in Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 29 and Part II, item 8, pages 34, 35, 37, 39, 43, 48 and 49,
     respectively, of this Form 10-K.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

           The Company has pending a number of lawsuits which have been
     filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover
     a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's entire business.
     The following is a brief description of the more significant of these
     categories of lawsuits and government regulations.  The Company does
     not believe that any such claims or lawsuits will have a material
     adverse affect on its financial condition or results of operations.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 7
          Franchising

           A substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised
     to independent businesspeople operating under arrangements with the
     Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional
     disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a
     broad range of subjects including, without limitation, quality,
     service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or
     terminations of franchises, franchisee claims for additional
     franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments.

          Suppliers

           The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply,
     with minor exceptions outside of the United States, food, paper, or
     related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon
     independent suppliers which are required to meet and maintain the
     Company's standards and specifications. There are a number of such
     suppliers worldwide and on occasion disputes arise between the Company
     and its suppliers on a number of issues including, by way of example,
     compliance with product specifications and McDonald's business
     relationship with suppliers.

          Employees

           Thousands of persons are employed by the Company and in
     restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In
     addition, thousands of persons, from time to time, seek employment in
     such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise
     regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.

          Customers

           McDonald's restaurants serve a large cross-section of the
     public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as
     to products, service, accidents and other matters typical of an
     extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.

          Trademarks

           McDonald's has registered trademarks and service marks, some of
     which are of material importance to the Company's business.  From time
     to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to defend and
     protect its use of such registered marks.

          Government Regulations

           Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and
     regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business,
     including, but not limited to, franchising, health, environment,
     zoning and employment. The Company does not believe that it is in
     violation of any existing statutory or administrative rules, but it
     cannot predict the effect on its operations from promulgation of
     additional requirements in the future.<PAGE>

     March 1, 1995 are shown below. Each of the executive officers has been

           The approximate number of shareholders of record and beneficial
     owners of the Company's common stock as of January 31, 1995 was
     estimated to be 537,000.

           Given the Company's returns on equity and assets, the Company's
     management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of
     earnings back into the business.  The Company has paid 76 consecutive
     quarterly dividends on common stock through March 29, 1995, has
     increased the per share amount 20 times since the first dividend was
     paid in 1976, and has increased the dividend amount every year.
     Additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing
     returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing
     needs.<PAGE>

     SYSTEMWIDE SALES AND RESTAURANTS
     Systemwide sales are comprised of sales by restaurants operated by the
     Company, franchisees and affiliates operating under joint-venture
     agreements between McDonald's and local businesspeople. The 1994
     increase was due to expansion, higher sales at existing restaurants
     and stronger foreign currencies, negatively affected in part by severe
     weather conditions worldwide in early 1994. The 1993 increase was due
     to expansion and higher sales at existing restaurants, offset in part
     by weaker foreign currencies and one less day in 1993 since 1992 was a
     leap year. Sales by Company-operated restaurants grew at a faster rate
     than Systemwide sales in 1994 because Company-operated expansion
     advanced at a faster rate than Systemwide expansion. Sales by Company-
     operated restaurants grew at a slower rate than Systemwide sales in
     1993 because weaker foreign currencies had a greater impact on sales
     by Company-operated restaurants than on Systemwide sales, and because
     of a greater number of franchised restaurants resulting from
     expansion.
       Average sales by restaurants open at least one year (excluding
     satellites) were $1,800,000 in 1994, $32,000 above 1993. Average sales
     in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. improved through the emphasis
     on value and customer satisfaction.
       Expansion continued at an accelerated pace as 1,212 restaurants
     (excluding satellites) were added in 1994, compared with 900 in 1993
     and 675 in 1992. Restaurants opened during the year (excluding
     satellites) contributed $799 million to Systemwide sales in 1994, $572
     million in 1993 and $478 million in 1992. McDonald's plans to add
     between 1,200 and 1,500 restaurants (excluding satellites) around the
     world in 1995 and in each of the next several years. The mix of net
     additions remains at one-third in the U.S. and two-thirds outside of
     the U.S.
       Our global expansion plan also includes satellites -- foodservice
     facilities that leverage the infrastructure of existing restaurants by
     using their storage capability and inventory, and by drawing on their
     management talent and labor pool. During 1994, 575 satellites were
     added around the world; we expect to open approximately 1,000
     satellites in 1995. The consolidated financial statements reflect the
     operating results of satellites on the same basis as traditional
     restaurants; the results of satellites operated by the Company are
     included in sales by and costs of Company-operated restaurants, while
     those operated by franchisees are included in revenues from and costs
     of franchised restaurants. Satellites in operation contributed $150
     million to Systemwide sales in 1994. The operating results of
     satellites were immaterial to consolidated operating results.

     TOTAL REVENUES
     Total revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants, and
     fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates based
     upon a percent of sales with specified minimum payments. The minimum
     fee is comprised of both a rent and service fee amount at a combined
     rate of approximately 12.5% of sales for new U.S. franchise
     arrangements. Prior to 1994 and since 1987, the minimum fee generally
     was a combined 12.0% for both rent and service fees. Higher fees are
     charged for sites that require a higher investment on the part of the
     Company. Fees paid by franchisees outside of the U.S. vary according<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 13
     to local business conditions. These fees, together with occupancy and
     operating rights, are stipulated in franchise arrangements that
     generally have 20-year terms, and provide a stable, predictable
     revenue flow to the Company.
       Revenues grow as locations are added and as sales build in existing
     locations. Menu price adjustments affect revenues as well as sales;
     however, due to different pricing structures, new products,
     promotions, and product mix variations among markets, it is
     impractical to quantify the impact of menu price adjustments for the
     System as a whole.
       The rate of increase in total revenues in 1994 was greater than the
     rate of increase in Systemwide sales due to strong global operating
     results and an increase in the Company-operated restaurant base
     through expansion and changes in ownership. The rate of increase in
     total revenues in 1993 was lower than the rate of increase in
     Systemwide sales due to weaker foreign currencies which had a greater
     impact on revenues than on Systemwide sales, and because of a greater
     number of franchised restaurants resulting from expansion.
       Growth rates in sales by Company-operated restaurants and revenues
     from franchised restaurants varied in 1993 because of expansion and
     changes in ownership and because sales by Company-operated restaurants
     were impacted to a greater degree by changing foreign currencies than
     were revenues. In 1994, about 56% of sales by Company-operated
     restaurants and 37% of revenues from franchised restaurants were
     outside of the U.S., compared with 53% and 33%, respectively, in 1993.

     RESTAURANT MARGINS
     Company-operated margins were 19.8% of sales in 1994, compared with
     19.2% in 1993 and 19.1% in 1992. In 1994, as a percent of sales, food
     and paper, and occupancy and other operating costs declined, while
     payroll costs increased. In 1993, as a percent of sales, food and
     paper costs rose, while occupancy, other operating and payroll costs
     declined.
       Franchised margins comprised about two-thirds of the combined
     operating margins. Consolidated franchised margins were 82.8% of
     applicable revenues in 1994, compared with 83.1% in 1993 and 82.8% in
     1992. The 1994 decrease reflected a higher proportion of leased sites
     resulting from accelerated expansion and satellite development, as
     financing costs embedded in operating leases were included in rent
     expense which does not occur if a site is owned.
       Franchised margins include revenues and expenses associated with
     restaurants operating under business facilities lease arrangements.
     Under these arrangements, the Company leases the businesses --
     including equipment -- to franchisees who have options to purchase the
     businesses. While higher fees are charged under these arrangements,
     margins are generally lower because of equipment depreciation. When
     these purchase options are exercised, resulting gains compensate the
     Company for lower margins prior to exercise and are included in other
     operating (income) expense--net. At year-end 1994, 476 restaurants
     were operating under such arrangements, compared with 544 and 583 at
     year-end 1993 and 1992, respectively.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 14
     GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SELLING EXPENSES
     The 1994 increase was primarily due to strategic global investment
     spending to support expansion and value, and a one-time, noncash $15
     million charge related to the early implementation of a new accounting
     rule regarding the timing of expensing advertising production costs.
     The 1993 increase was primarily due to higher employee costs
     associated with expansion and key priorities, partially offset by
     weaker foreign currencies. These expenses as a percent of Systemwide
     sales have remained relatively constant over the past five years, and
     were 4.2% in 1994 and 4.0% in 1993.

     OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE--NET
     This category is comprised of transactions which relate to franchising
     and the foodservice business such as gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and net
     gains or losses from property dispositions. The 1994 income increase
     reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses and higher
     income from affiliates, offset in part by higher losses on property
     dispositions. The 1993 and 1992 amounts were relatively constant,
     reflecting greater income from affiliates and gains on sales of
     restaurant businesses in 1993, and by the favorable settlement of a
     sales tax case in Brazil in 1992.
       Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from
     exercises of purchase options by franchisees operating under business
     facilities lease arrangements and from sales of Company-operated
     restaurants. As a franchisor, McDonald's purchases and sells
     businesses in transactions with franchisees and affiliates in an
     ongoing effort to achieve the optimal ownership mix in each market.
     These transactions and resulting gains are integral to franchising and
     as such, are appropriately recorded in operating income.
       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is reported after
     interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. partnerships which
     are reported before income taxes. The Company actively participates
     in, but does not control, these businesses.
       Net gains or losses from property dispositions result from
     disposals of excess properties through closings, relocations and other
     transactions.

     OPERATING INCOME
     The 1994 and 1993 increases reflected higher combined operating
     margins, partially offset by higher general, administrative and
     selling expenses. Additionally, 1994 was positively impacted by higher
     other operating income and stronger foreign currencies, while 1993 was
     negatively impacted by weaker foreign currencies.

     INTEREST EXPENSE
     The 1994 decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates,
     partially offset by higher debt levels and stronger foreign
     currencies. The 1993 decrease was primarily due to lower average debt
     balances, lower average interest rates and weaker foreign currencies.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 15
     NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)--NET
     This category includes interest income, gains and losses related to
     investments and financings, as well as miscellaneous income and
     expense. Higher translation losses, principally from Mexico and
     Brazil, losses on investments and higher minority interest charges
     impacted 1994. Also contributing to the year-over-year change were
     gains on debt extinguishments and higher interest income in 1993. The
     1993 increase reflected $9 million in gains related to debt
     extinguishments in 1993 and $29 million in charges related to various
     early redemptions of high-coupon, U.S. Dollar debt in 1992.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
     The effective tax rate was 35.1% in 1994, compared with 35.4% in 1993
     and 33.8% in 1992. The 1993 increase was primarily the result of new
     U.S. tax legislation enacted that year, which negatively impacted the
     provision by approximately $20 million. Of this amount, nearly $14
     million was attributable to a one-time, noncash revaluation of
     deferred tax liabilities. The Company expects its 1995 effective
     income tax rate to be between 35.0% and 35.5%.
       Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets of
     $233 million in 1994, net of valuation allowance, and $148 million in
     1993. Substantially all of the tax assets arose in the U.S. and other
     profitable markets, the majority of which is expected to be realized
     in future U.S. income tax returns.

     NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
     Net income and net income per common share increased 13% and 16%,
     respectively, in 1994. The spreads between the percent increases in
     net income and net income per common share reflected the impact of
     share repurchase. Net income and net income per common share increased
     13% and 12%, respectively, in 1993. These increases were negatively
     affected by weaker foreign currencies and new U.S. tax legislation.<PAGE>

     IMPACT OF CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCIES
     Changing foreign currencies affect reported results. McDonald's
     lessens short-term cash exposures principally by purchasing goods and
     services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and
     hedging foreign-denominated cash flows. In 1994, stronger foreign
     currencies positively contributed to operating income, but their
     impact on interest expense and higher translation losses in Latin
     America more than offset this benefit, resulting in a reduction in net
     income. Weaker foreign currencies had a significant negative impact on
     1993 results. Further discussion of our management of changing foreign
     currencies is on pages 26 through 29 in the commentary on financings
     and total shareholders' equity.

     SALES
     The 1994 and 1993 increases were due to expansion and higher sales at
     existing restaurants. Positive comparable sales were achieved in 1994
     through an emphasis on value and customer satisfaction in the form of
     Extra Value Meals, Happy Meals and the three-tier value program; as
     well as through promotions run during the year in the form of the NBA
     cup highlighting large sandwiches, the Flintstones movie tie-in
     featuring the McRib Grand Poobah Meal and a set of four Bedrock mugs,
     the Dream Team II collector cup, the Music Event offering four artist
     collections with the purchase of a large sandwich or Extra Value Meal,
     and the Holiday Video offering of four videotapes.

     RESTAURANTS
     There were 461 restaurants added in the U.S. in 1994, representing 38%
     of Systemwide additions, compared with 324 and 36% in 1993, and 363
     and 56% five years ago. In addition, 494 U.S. satellites were
     operating at year-end 1994, compared with 114 at year-end 1993.
     McDonald's expects to maintain the current level of U.S. expansion in
     1995 and in each of the next several years by adding between 400 and
     500 restaurants each year, exclusive of satellites.

       Restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates represented 84%
     of U.S. restaurants at year-end 1994, compared with 85% at year-end
     1993 and 79% five years ago. During the period 1989 through 1991, the
     Company franchised certain restaurants it previously operated because
     entrepreneurial owners with an equity stake in the business improved
     operations, sales and profits as well as consolidated profits. Since
     1990, we have continued to make operational improvements and reduce
     operating and development costs; as a result, over the past several
     years, our base of restaurants has grown at a faster rate.

     U.S. revenues were positively impacted by strong sales and expansion
     in 1994 and 1993, and negatively affected in 1992, 1991 and 1990 by
     the franchising of certain Company-operated restaurant businesses.
       U.S. Company-operated margins increased $42 million or 9% in 1994,
     reflecting sales improvement and growth in the number of Company-
     operated restaurants. These margins were 19.0% of sales in 1994,
     compared with 18.3% in 1993 and 18.4% in 1992. In 1994, the margin
     benefited from lower commodity costs and improvements in processing
     for beef. U.S. franchised margins rose $71 million or 6% in 1994.
     These margins were 83.2% of applicable revenues in 1994, compared with
     83.6% in 1993 and 83.2% in 1992. Franchised margins as a percent of
     revenues decreased in 1994 because rent expense grew at a faster rate
     than revenues, resulting from a higher proportion of leased openings.
       While it is difficult to assess potential effects of federal and
     state legislation in the U.S. that may impact the industry, the
     Company believes it can maintain operating margins within the
     historical range of the past ten years by continuing to build sales
     and reduce costs.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 19
     U.S. operating income rose $43 million or 4% in 1994, and was 50% of
     consolidated operating income, compared with 55% in 1993. The 1994 and
     1993 increases resulted primarily from higher combined operating
     margins, partially offset by higher general, administrative and
     selling expenses in the form of higher employee costs, other
     expenditures to support our global strategies and a one-time $12
     million charge related to the implementation of the new accounting
     rule for advertising costs in 1994. Without this charge, U.S.
     operating income would have grown by 5% in 1994. Operating income
     included $366 million of depreciation and amortization in 1994,
     compared with $348 million in 1993 and $330 million in 1992.
       While the U.S. market remains highly competitive, McDonald's is
     confident of continued growth through a greater emphasis on value and
     customer satisfaction, and through expansion.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     U.S. assets increased $297 million or 5% in 1994, driven by higher
     expenditures for restaurant property and buildings resulting from
     expansion. At year-end 1994, 49% of consolidated assets were located
     in the U.S., compared with 53% at year-end 1993. Capital expenditures
     rose $126 million or 22% in 1994, and represented 46% of consolidated
     capital expenditures, compared with 55% five years ago. These amounts
     excluded expenditures made by franchisees such as their initial
     investments in equipment, signs, seating and decor, as well as long-
     term, ongoing reinvestment in their businesses. New restaurant
     expenditures grew $140 million or 42% because of accelerated
     expansion, tempered by lower average development costs, and included
     $41 million related to satellite development.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included modifications to
     achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and implementation of
     technology to improve service and food quality. The decline since 1990
     reflected cost reduction efforts and aggressive reinvestment in prior
     years. Rebuilding and relocating restaurants has generated additional
     sales, reflecting our ability to adjust to changing demographics,
     traffic patterns and market opportunities. More than $40 million were
     spent for these investments in 1994, and $249 million over the past
     five years.<PAGE>

     =========================================================================

       Average development costs have steadily decreased since 1990 due to
     efforts to optimize building designs and standardize development.
     Average land costs declined as a result of the increase in low-cost
     building designs, which utilize smaller land parcels. Average building
     costs remained relatively flat reflecting the benefits of these
     building designs and construction efficiencies. Low-cost building
     designs comprised nearly 83% of 1994 openings compared with 80% in
     1993. Average equipment costs decreased due to standardization and
     global sourcing. McDonald's intends to pursue ongoing development cost
     reductions by taking further advantage of standardization, global
     sourcing and economies of scale.
       These lower-cost, lower-volume building designs allow us to
     profitably expand into more locations. This is consistent with
     McDonald's goal of increasing market share with greater marketwide
     presence around the world.
       The Company continues to emphasize restaurant property ownership,
     because real estate ownership yields long-term benefits, including the
     ability to fix occupancy costs. However, most satellites are leased
     locations. In addition to purchasing new properties, the Company
     acquires previously leased properties and owned 69% of U.S. sites at
     year-end 1994, the same as five years ago.<PAGE>

     OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     SALES
     Sales outside of the U.S. rose 18% in 1994 due to expansion, higher
     sales at existing restaurants as comparable sales on a local currency
     basis were positive, and stronger foreign currencies. The 1993
     increase was negatively impacted by weaker foreign currencies, most
     notably the European currencies, as well as the Canadian and
     Australian Dollars. Strong operating results have been achieved in the
     past several years despite weak economies in several countries,
     particularly Canada, England and Japan.

       Although many European economies were weak over the past 18 months,
     McDonald's markets generally performed well.  Throughout 1994,
     comparable sales in France and Germany were not as strong as in prior
     years because of the economy, unusually hot weather in the summer, and
     World Cup Soccer.  Yet, growth and profitability in both markets were
     very good.  Pacific sales were strong with the exception of our joint
     venture in Japan, which has been affected by a weak economy.
     Transaction counts and profits were up in Japan, but sales trends had
     not fundamentally improved.  Business in Canada continued to improve,
     despite a weak economy. Latin American economies have been weak, but
     our business there has been quite good, particularly in Brazil, since
     the mid-year economic reforms.  Results in Mexico in 1994 were
     impacted by the continuing sluggish economy and in December, by the
     devaluation of the Mexican peso. We expect this impact to continue
     into 1995.
       In 1994, many markets delivered excellent sales growth on a local
     currency basis: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
     Canada, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
     Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
     Panama, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Scotland, Singapore, South Korea,
     Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Wales.

     RESTAURANTS
     During the past five years, 66% of Systemwide additions have been
     outside of the U.S. Of the 751 restaurants added in 1994, 51% were in
     the six largest markets, compared with 54% in 1993 and 57% in 1992.
     This continued relative decline is indicative of the growing
     importance of emerging markets. McDonald's expects to boost expansion
     outside of the U.S. in 1995 and in each of the next several years by
     adding between 800 and 1,000 restaurants, exclusive of satellites.<PAGE>

       The 1994 and 1993 revenue and operating income increases reflected
     expansion and higher combined operating margins, partially offset by
     higher general, administrative and selling expenses. Changing foreign
     currencies had a positive effect in 1994 and a negative effect in
     1993; higher other operating income helped 1994.
       Company-operated margins remained strong, increasing $114 million or
     21% in 1994. These margins improved to 20.5% of sales in 1994,
     compared with 20.1% in 1993 and 19.8% in 1992. Franchised margins grew
     $151 million or 25% in 1994. These margins were 82.1% of applicable
     revenues in 1994, compared with 82.0% in 1993 and 82.1% in 1992.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 23
       The 1994 and 1993 increases in general, administrative and selling
     expenses were primarily due to higher employee costs associated with
     expansion.
       The 1994 increase in other operating income was primarily due to
     gains on sales of restaurant businesses, greater affiliate earnings
     from Japan and other markets, and gains resulting from property
     dispositions. Other operating income decreased in 1993 due to the
     favorable settlement of a sales tax case in Brazil in 1992, offset
     somewhat by 1993 increases in gains on sales of restaurant businesses
     and greater affiliate earnings.
       Operations outside of the U.S. continued to contribute greater
     amounts to consolidated results as shown below:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment accounted for 63% of revenues
     and 61% of operating income outside of the U.S. in 1994, growing $369
     and $124 million, respectively. Germany, England and France accounted
     for 82% of this segment's operating income, compared with 85% in 1993.
     The 1994 increases were primarily due to strong operating results in
     these countries, as well as many emerging markets. The 1993 increases
     were primarily due to strong operating results in Germany and France,
     as well as many emerging markets, offset by weaker foreign currencies;
     England's operating income was significantly impacted by the weaker
     currency.
       Asia/Pacific revenues grew $236 million and operating income
     increased $52 million in 1994; 87% of operating income was contributed
     by Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The 1994 and 1993 increases
     were attributable to expansion and developing economies in many
     markets, with the exception of our affiliate in Japan which continued
     to suffer from a weak economy. The change in ownership of Taiwan from
     an affiliate to a wholly-owned subsidiary was also a benefit in 1994.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 24
       Canadian revenues decreased $12 million in 1994 due to the negative
     impact of the weaker currency; revenues would have increased $21
     million in 1994 if the exchange rate had remained at its 1993 level.
     Operating income increased $6 million because of lower operating costs
     and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, partially offset
     by the weaker currency.
       Latin American revenues grew $95 million, while operating income
     increased $32 million in 1994. The 1994 increases in revenues and
     operating income were primarily a function of expansion, as well as a
     strengthening of the Brazilian market since the mid-year economic
     reforms. However, operating income in Mexico was down because of the
     economy and peso devaluation. The 1993 increase in revenues was
     primarily a function of expansion, while the decrease in operating
     income reflected the favorable settlement of a sales tax case in
     Brazil in 1992, partially offset by better results in Argentina in
     1993. Brazil was also affected by a weak economy in 1993 and 1992.

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Assets outside of the U.S. rose $1.3 billion or 22% in 1994 due to
     expansion and stronger foreign currencies. At year-end 1994, about 51%
     of consolidated assets were located outside of the U.S.; 60% of these
     assets were located in England, Germany, France, Australia and Canada.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       In the past five years, nearly $3.9 billion were invested outside
     of the U.S.; in 1994, capital expenditures rose in all geographic
     segments. Approximately 70% of capital expenditures outside of the
     U.S. were invested in Europe -- principally in Germany, France and
     England.
       In general, average development costs for new restaurants for the
     five largest, majority-owned markets -- Australia, Canada, England,
     France and Germany -- were nearly double the U.S. average; such costs
     accommodate higher sales volumes and transaction counts. Since 1991,
     average development costs have decreased due to construction and
     design efficiencies, standardization, global sourcing and changes in
     the mix of openings.
       These lower-cost, lower-volume building designs allow us to
     profitably expand into more locations. This is consistent with
     McDonald's goal of increasing market share with greater marketwide
     presence around the world.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 25
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included seating and decor
     upgrades, and equipment required for new products and operating
     efficiencies. The majority of these expenditures were in Europe.
     Expenditures for other properties were principally for office
     facilities.
       As in the U.S., business outside of the U.S. emphasizes restaurant
     property ownership. However, various laws and regulations make
     property acquisition and ownership much more difficult than in the
     U.S. Ownership is obtained when practical; otherwise, long-term leases
     are a viable alternative. In addition, certain markets have laws and
     customs that offer stronger tenancy rights than are available in the
     U.S. The Company and affiliates owned 36% of sites outside of the U.S.
     at year-end 1994, compared with 35% five years ago.
       Capital expenditures made by affiliates -- which were not included
     in consolidated amounts -- were $203 million in 1994, compared with
     $207 million in 1993. The majority of 1994 expenditures were for
     development in Japan, Argentina, Sweden and Singapore.<PAGE>

     FINANCIAL POSITION
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     TOTAL ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Total assets grew approximately $1.6 billion or 13% in 1994; net
     property and equipment represented 83% of total assets and rose $1.2
     billion. Capital expenditures increased $213 million or 16%,
     reflecting higher expansion, partially offset by lower average
     development costs and stronger foreign currencies.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS
     Cash provided by operations increased $246 million or 15% in 1994.
     Together with other sources of cash such as borrowings, cash provided
     by operations was used principally for capital expenditures, debt
     repayments, share repurchase and dividends. For the fourth straight
     year, cash provided by operations exceeded capital expenditures.
       While cash generated is significant relative to cash required, the
     Company also has the ability to meet short-term needs through
     commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
     Accordingly, a relatively low current ratio has been purposefully
     maintained; it was .30 at year-end 1994.
       The Company believes that cash flow measures are meaningful
     indicators of growth and financial strength, when evaluated in the
     context of absolute dollars, uses and consistency. Over the past five
     years, cash flow coverage has improved significantly. Cash provided by
     operations is expected to cover capital expenditures over the next
     several years, even as expansion continues to accelerate.

     FINANCINGS
     The Company strives to minimize interest expense and the impact of
     changing foreign currencies while maintaining the capacity to meet
     increasing growth requirements. To accomplish these objectives,
     McDonald's generally finances long-term assets with long-term debt in
     the currencies in which the assets are denominated, while remaining
     flexible to take advantage of changing foreign currencies and interest
     rates.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 27
       Over the years, major capital markets and various techniques have
     been utilized to meet financing requirements and reduce interest
     expense. Currency exchange agreements have been employed in
     conjunction with borrowings to obtain desired currencies at attractive
     rates. Interest-rate exchange agreements have been used to effectively
     convert fixed-rate to floating-rate debt, or vice versa. Foreign-
     denominated debt has been used to lessen the impact of changing
     foreign currencies on net income and shareholders' equity. Total
     foreign-denominated debt, including the effects of currency exchange
     agreements, was $4.0 and $3.1 billion at year-end 1994 and 1993,
     respectively.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Company manages its debt portfolio in order to respond to
     changes in interest rates and foreign currencies and accordingly,
     periodically retires, redeems, and repurchases debt; terminates
     exchange agreements; and uses derivatives. While changing foreign
     currencies affect reported results, the Company actively hedges seven
     foreign currencies -- Japanese Yen, Deutsche Mark, French Franc,
     British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Swiss
     Franc -- to minimize the cash exposure of royalty and other payments
     received in the U.S. in local currencies.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 28
          The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity
     or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not
     hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes; all exchange
     agreements are over-the-counter instruments. McDonald's restaurants
     also primarily purchase goods and services in local currencies
     resulting in natural hedges. McDonald's typically finances in local
     currencies creating economic hedges; and the Company's exposure is
     diversified within a basket of currencies, as opposed to one or
     several. The Company's largest net asset exposures (defined as total
     assets less foreign-denominated liabilities) by foreign currency were
     as follows:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------


       Moody's and Standard & Poor's have rated McDonald's debt Aa2 and
     AA, respectively, since 1982. Duff & Phelps began rating the debt in
     1990, and currently rates it AA+. At the present time, these strong
     ratings are important to us in the context of our global development
     plans. The Company has not experienced, nor does it expect to
     experience, difficulty in obtaining financing or in refinancing
     existing debt. At year-end 1994, the Company and its subsidiaries had
     $1.7 billion available under line of credit agreements and $585
     million under previously filed shelf registrations available for
     future debt issuance.
       Although McDonald's prefers to own real estate, leases are an
     alternative financing method. As in the past, some new properties will
     be leased. Such leases frequently include renewal and/or purchase
     options. In the past five years, McDonald's has leased properties
     related to 40% of U.S. openings (excluding satellites) and 64% of
     openings outside of the U.S. (excluding satellites).
       Since 1990, the Company has improved its balance sheet by reducing
     leverage while simultaneously increasing expansion and repurchasing
     shares.

     TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     Total shareholders' equity rose $611 million or 10% in 1994,
     representing 51% of total assets at year-end 1994. One technique used
     to enhance common shareholder value is to repurchase shares with our
     excess cash flow or debt capacity, while maintaining a strong equity
     base for future expansion. At year-end 1994, the market value of
     shares repurchased and recorded as common stock in treasury was
     $4.0 billion, compared to their cost of $2.4 billion.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 29
       In conjunction with efforts to enhance common shareholder value,
     the Company repurchased about $500 million of its common stock in
     1994, representing half of the three-year $1.0 billion program
     announced in January 1994. In 1993, the Company completed a $700
     million common share repurchase program begun in 1992. In 1992, in
     order to lower the cost of equity capital, the Company issued $500
     million of Series E 7.72% Cumulative Preferred Stock; at the same
     time, the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million common share
     repurchase program. Subsequently, the Board authorized an additional
     $200 million expenditure for share repurchase in 1993.
       Stronger foreign currencies added $77 million to shareholders'
     equity in 1994. At year-end 1994, foreign-denominated assets not
     entirely financed with related foreign-denominated debt were
     principally located in England, Canada, Australia, France and Austria.
     At year-end 1994, assets in hyperinflationary markets and in Mexico
     were principally financed in U.S. Dollars.

     RETURNS
     Return on average assets is computed using operating income. Net
     income, less preferred stock dividends (net of tax in 1994, 1993 and
     1992), is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end
     balances are used to compute both average assets and average common
     equity.


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    1994    1993     1992     1991     1990

     Return on average assets       17.6    17.0     16.4     15.7     16.3

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The improvements in return on average assets since 1991 reflected
     better global operating results and a slower rate of asset growth. The
     1994 and 1993 improvements in return on average common equity
     reflected higher levels of share repurchase, whereas declines in 1992
     and 1991 resulted from lower levels of share repurchase as excess cash
     flow was used to reduce debt.

     EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES--INFLATION
     McDonald's has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost
     increases effectively. Rapid inventory turnover, ability to adjust
     prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings -- many of
     which are at fixed costs and partially financed by debt made cheaper
     by inflation -- have enabled McDonald's to mitigate the effects of
     inflation. In hyperinflationary markets, menu board prices typically
     are adjusted to keep pace, thereby mitigating the effect on reported
     results.<PAGE>

     MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair
     presentation of the consolidated financial statements and Financial
     Comments appearing in this annual report. The financial statements
     were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
     principles and include certain amounts based on management's judgment
     and best estimates. Other financial information presented in the
     annual report is consistent with the financial statements.
       The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
     reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized
     acquisition, use or disposition, which is designed to provide
     reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of
     Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial
     statements and such asset safeguarding. The system includes a
     documented organizational structure and appropriate division of
     responsibilities; established policies and procedures which are
     communicated throughout the Company; careful selection, training, and
     development of our people; and utilization of an internal audit
     program. Policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all
     employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and that
     business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a
     manner which is above reproach.
       There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system
     of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the
     circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
     effective internal control system can provide only reasonable
     assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
     safeguarding of assets. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal
     control system can change with circumstances. The Company believes
     that at December 31, 1994, it maintained an effective system of
     internal control over financial reporting and safeguarding of assets
     against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.
       The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
     independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, who were given unrestricted
     access to all financial records and related data. The audit report of
     Ernst & Young LLP is presented herein.
       The Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee
     composed entirely of outside Directors, provides oversight to the
     financial reporting process. Ernst & Young LLP has independent access
     to the Audit Committee and periodically meets with the Committee to
     discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Board of Directors and Shareholders
     McDonald's Corporation
     Oak Brook, Illinois

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
     McDonald's Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and
     1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
     equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
     December 31, 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility
     of McDonald's Corporation management. Our responsibility is to express
     an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
     the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.
       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
     of McDonald's Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and
     1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
     flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
     1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     MCDONALD'S CORPORATION FINANCIAL COMMENTS

     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
     Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in 50% or less owned
     affiliates are carried at equity in the companies' net assets.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
     The functional currency of each operation outside of the U.S. is the
     respective local currency, except for hyperinflationary countries
     where it is the U.S. Dollar.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and
     amortization provided on the straight-line method over the following
     estimated useful lives: buildings--up to 40 years; leasehold
     improvements--lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms
     including option periods; and equipment--3 to 12 years.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangible assets consist primarily of franchise rights reacquired
     from franchisees and affiliates, and are amortized on the straight-
     line method over an average life of 30 years.

     ADVERTISING COSTS
     In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company adopted the American
     Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 93-7,
     Reporting on Advertising Costs. Under its provisions, the Company
     expenses production costs of radio and television ads as of the date
     the commercials are initially aired. As a result, the Company recorded
     a one-time, noncash $15.0 million charge to general, administrative
     and selling expenses in the fourth quarter. Advertising expenses
     included in costs of Company-operated restaurants and general,
     administrative and selling expenses were (in millions): 1994--$385.6;
     1993--$353.8; 1992--$355.7.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 38
     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The Company utilizes derivatives in managing risk, but not for trading
     purposes. Non-U.S. Dollar financing transactions generally are
     effective as hedges of long-term investments or intercompany loans in
     the corresponding currency. Foreign currency gains and losses on the
     hedges of long-term investments are recorded as foreign currency
     translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity. Gains and
     losses related to hedges of intercompany loans offset the gains and
     losses on intercompany loans and are recorded in nonoperating income
     (expense). Interest-rate exchange agreements are designated and
     effective to modify the Company's interest-rate exposures. Net
     interest is accrued as either interest receivable or payable with the
     offset recorded in interest expense. The Company also uses short-term
     forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge future foreign-denominated
     royalty cash flows and other payments received in the U.S. from
     foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Gains and losses associated with
     these contracts are deferred and amortized over the twelve-month
     period being hedged.
       The carrying amounts for cash and equivalents and notes receivable
     approximated fair value. For noninterest-bearing security deposits by
     franchisees, no fair value was provided as these deposits are an
     integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.

     STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with short-term
     maturity dates to be cash equivalents. The impact of changing foreign
     currencies on cash and equivalents was not material.<PAGE>

     ======================================================================

     Franchisees operating under business facilities lease arrangements
     have options to purchase the businesses. The results of operations of
     restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with
     franchisees and affiliates were not material to the consolidated
     financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. In 1994,
     due to increased ownership, the Company consolidated affiliates in
     Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey and China, which increased total assets
     and liabilities by approximately $205.0 million.

       Satellite foodservice facilities are points of distribution which

       Included in the 1993 deferred tax provision were $14.0 million
     attributable to a one-time, noncash revaluation of deferred tax
     liabilities resulting from the increase in the statutory U.S. federal
     income tax rate.
       Net deferred tax liabilities consisted of:

       Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been provided on basis differences
     related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.
     These basis differences were approximately $675.0 million at December
     31, 1994, and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings which are
     considered to be permanently invested in the businesses. If these
     earnings were not considered permanently invested, no additional taxes
     would be provided due to the overall higher tax rates in markets outside
     of the U.S. and the ability to recover withholding taxes as foreign tax
     credits in the U.S.<PAGE>

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     DEBT FINANCING
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
     The Company has a line of credit agreement for $700.0 million, which
     remained unused at December 31, 1994, and which may be renewed on an
     annual basis unless the participating banks notify the Company four
     days prior to the renewal period. Prior to July 20, 1994, the
     agreement could not be terminated without 18 months notice and
     supported the classification of certain notes maturing within one year
     as long-term debt. Each borrowing under the current agreement bears
     interest at one of several specified floating rates to be selected by
     the Company at the time of borrowing. The agreement provides for fees
     of .07% per annum on the unused portion of the commitment. In
     addition, certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. had unused lines of
     credit totaling $1.0 billion at December 31, 1994; these were
     principally short-term and denominated in various currencies at local
     market rates of interest. The weighted average interest rates of
     short-term borrowings, comprised of commercial paper and foreign-
     denominated bank line borrowings, were 6.8% and 8.1% at December 31,
     1994, and 1993, respectively.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 44
     EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS
     The Company has entered into agreements for the exchange of various
     currencies, certain of which also provide for the periodic exchange of
     interest payments. These agreements, as well as additional interest-
     rate exchange agreements, expire through 2003. The interest-rate
     exchange agreements had a notional amount with a U.S. Dollar
     equivalent of $1.3 billion at December 31, 1994, and were denominated
     primarily in U.S. Dollars, British Pounds Sterling, French Francs,
     Deutsche Marks and Japanese Yen. The net value of each exchange
     agreement was classified as an asset or liability based on its
     carrying amount, and any related interest income was netted against
     interest expense.
       The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group
     of financial institutions. The Company continually monitors its
     positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and adjusts
     positions as appropriate. The Company does not have a significant
     exposure to any individual counterparty, and has entered into master
     agreements that contain netting arrangements.
       The Company also had short-term forward foreign exchange contracts
     outstanding at December 31, 1994, with a U.S. Dollar equivalent of
     $65.2 million in various currencies, primarily payable in French
     Francs, Deutsche Marks, British Pounds Sterling and Japanese Yen. The
     deferred loss related to the short-term hedging program was $1.7
     million at December 31, 1994.

     GUARANTEES
     Included in total debt at December 31, 1994, were $159.5 million of
     7.5% ESOP Notes Series A and $83.3 million of 7.2% ESOP Notes Series B
     issued by the Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (LESOP), with
     payments through 2004 and 2006, respectively, which are guaranteed by
     the Company. Interest rates on the notes were adjusted in 1994 due to
     refinancing of certain sinking fund payments. The Company has agreed
     to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain events.
       The Company also has guaranteed certain foreign affiliate loans
     totaling $66.9 million at December 31, 1994. The Company also was a
     general partner in 70 domestic partnerships with total assets of
     $287.0 million and total liabilities of $141.3 million at December 31,
     1994.<PAGE>

     ======================================================================

     The carrying amounts for short-term forward foreign exchange contracts
     approximated fair value at December 31, 1994. The fair value of the
     debt obligations (excluding capital leases) and of the currency and
     interest-rate exchange agreements was estimated using quoted market
     prices, various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses. The
     Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its
     debt prior to maturity. Given the market value of its common stock and
     its significant real estate holdings, the Company believes that the
     fair value of total assets was higher than their carrying value at
     December 31, 1994.

     DEBT OBLIGATIONS
     The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through various
     public and private offerings and bank loans. The terms of most debt
     obligations contain restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages
     and long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements,
     the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at
     par or at a premium over par. The following table summarizes these
     debt obligations, including the gross effects of currency and
     interest-rate exchange agreements:<PAGE>

     Sterling of 5.91% Series A Preferred Stock in 1993. Unless redeemed at
     the Company's option, each series of preferred stock must be redeemed
     five years from the date of issuance. These combined preferred
     interests were valued at U.S. $117.4 million at December 31, 1994.
     Also, another subsidiary issued additional preferred stock in 1994 and
     1993. All of the preferred stock of this subsidiary has a dividend
     rate adjusted annually (7.5% at December 31, 1994) and is redeemable
     at the option of the holder at a current redemption price totaling
     $45.0 million. Each of these issues was reflected in preferred
     interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
       Included in other was the $100.00 per share redemption value of
     181,868 shares of 5% Series D Preferred Stock. This stock, which

     LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1994, the Company was lessee at 2,553 locations under
     ground leases (the Company leases land and constructs and owns
     buildings) and at 3,268 locations under improved leases (lessor owns
     land and buildings). Land and building lease terms for most
     traditional restaurants are generally for 20 to 25 years and, in many
     cases, provide for rent escalations and one or more five-year renewal
     options with certain leases providing purchase options. Most
     satellites operate under improved leases which are generally of a
     shorter term and include primarily percentage rent payments only. For
     most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy
     costs which include property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In
     addition, the Company is lessee under noncancelable leases covering
     offices and vehicles.
       Future minimum payments required under operating leases with
     initial terms of one year or more after December 31, 1994, are:

     FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS

     Franchise arrangements, with franchisees who operate throughout the
     U.S. and in most countries around the world, generally provide for
     initial fees and continuing payments to the Company based upon a
     percentage of sales, with minimum rent payments. Among other things,
     franchisees are provided the use of restaurant facilities, generally
     for a period of 20 years. They are required to pay related occupancy
     costs which include property taxes, insurance, maintenance and a
     refundable, noninterest-bearing security deposit. On a limited basis,
     the Company accepts notes from franchisees, which generally are
     secured by interests in restaurant equipment and franchises.

     PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company has a program for U.S. employees which includes profit
     sharing, 401(k) (McDESOP), and leveraged employee stock ownership
     features. Profit sharing assets can be invested in McDonald's common
     stock or among several other investment alternatives. McDESOP allows
     employees to invest in McDonald's common stock by making contributions
     which are partially matched by the Company. LESOP is invested in both
     McDonald's convertible preferred and common stock.
       Staff, executives and restaurant managers share in profit sharing
     contributions; shares are released under the LESOP based on
     participants' compensation. The profit sharing contribution is
     discretionary, and the amount is determined by the Company each year.
     The LESOP contribution is based on the loan payments necessary to
     amortize the debt initially incurred to acquire the convertible
     preferred stock, some of which has been converted to common stock.
     Shares held by the LESOP are allocated to participants as the loan is
     repaid. Dividends on shares held by the LESOP are used to service the
     debt, and shares are released to participants in order to replace the
     dividends on shares that have been allocated to them.
       LESOP costs shown in the following table were based upon the cash
     paid for loan payments less these dividends.

       Assuming conversion of the preferred stock to common stock, at
     December 31, 1994, 4.4 million and 10.7 million shares would have been
     allocated and unallocated, respectively; no shares were committed to
     be released.
       Certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. also offer profit sharing,
     stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs
     outside of the U.S. were (in millions): 1994--$15.7; 1993--$13.0;
     1992--$14.0.

     STOCK OPTIONS
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Under the 1992 Stock Ownership Incentive and the 1975 Stock Ownership
     Option Plans, options to purchase common stock are granted at prices
     not less than fair market value of the stock on date of grant.
     Substantially all of these options become exercisable in four equal
     biennial installments, commencing one year from date of grant, and
     expiring ten years from date of grant. At December 31, 1994, 79.0
     million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under both
     plans.

       During the past several years, the Financial Accounting Standards
     Board has been considering the appropriate accounting for stock
     options, and in December 1994, decided to work towards improving
     disclosures about stock-based awards. Pending the resolution of this
     issue, the following table provides additional information regarding
     the Company's option program. The Company surveyed its institutional
     investors regarding the appropriate disclosures for stock-based
     awards, and the content contained herein reflects the information
     which they considered to be of value.
       The potential dilution of common shares outstanding upon exercise
     of stock options represents the number of common shares issuable upon
     exercise less the number of common shares that could be repurchased
     with proceeds from the exercise based upon the respective December 31
     prices of the Company's common stock. As such, this potential dilution
     was 1.6%, 1.8% and 1.7% at year-end 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     Options outstanding at December 31, 1994, had an average life of 7.4
     years if held to their expiration date; options are generally
     exercised prior to their expiration date.<PAGE>

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       As shown above, the average option exercise price has consistently
     exceeded the average cost of treasury stock issued for option
     exercises because of the Company's practice of prefunding the program
     through share repurchase. As a result, stock option exercises have
     generated additional capital, as cash received from employees has
     exceeded the Company's average acquisition cost of treasury stock.
       Options granted during each year were 1.9%, 1.7% and 1.6% of
     average common shares outstanding for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
     respectively. Stock options were granted to approximately 6,600, 5,800
     and 5,700 employees in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Shares are
     issued from treasury stock to employees upon exercise of stock
     options.<PAGE>

     transfer of an appropriate amount to common stock from additional
     paid-in capital.

     PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION
     Income used in the computation of per common share information was
     reduced by preferred stock cash dividends (net of tax) and divided by
     the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during each
     year (in millions): 1994--701.8; 1993--711.8; 1992--726.5. The effect
     of potentially dilutive securities was not material.

     PREFERRED STOCK
     In December 1992, the Company issued $500.0 million of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock; 10,000 preferred shares are equivalent to
     20.0 million depositary shares having a liquidation preference of
     $25.00 per depositary share. Each preferred share is entitled to one
     vote under certain circumstances and is redeemable at the option of
     the Company beginning on December 3, 1997, at its liquidation
     preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
       In September 1989 and April 1991, the Company sold $200.0 million
     of Series B and $100.0 million of Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred
     Stock to the LESOP. The LESOP financed the purchase by issuing notes
     which are guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term
     debt, with an offsetting reduction in shareholders' equity. Each
     preferred share has a liquidation preference of $14.375 and $16.5625,
     respectively, and is convertible into a minimum of .7692 and .8 common
     share (conversion rate), respectively. Upon termination of employment,
     employees are guaranteed a minimum value payable in common shares
     equal to the greater of the conversion rate; the fair market value of
     their preferred shares; or the liquidation preference plus accrued
     dividends, not to exceed one common share. Each preferred share is
     entitled to one vote and currently is redeemable at the option of the
     Company. In 1992, 8.2 million Series B shares were converted into 6.4
     million common shares.<PAGE>

     COMMON EQUITY PUT OPTIONS
     In June 1994, the Company sold 2.0 million common equity put options
     which were exercised in November 1994. During November and December
     1994, the Company sold an additional 2.0 million common equity put
     options which expired unexercised in the first quarter of 1995. At
     December 31, 1994, the $56.2 million exercise price of these options
     was classified in common equity put options, and the related offset
     was recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.
         In April 1993, the Company sold 1.0 million common equity put
     options which expired unexercised in July 1993. In December 1992, the
     Company sold 2.0 million common equity put options which expired
     unexercised in April 1993. At December 31, 1992, the $94.0 million
     exercise price of these options was classified in common equity put
     options and the related offset was recorded in common stock in
     treasury, net of premiums received.

     SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
     In December 1988, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred
     Share Purchase Right (Right) on each outstanding share of common
     stock. Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to
     purchase one four-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
     Participating Preferred Stock (the economic equivalent of one common
     share) at an exercise price of $62.50 (which may be adjusted under
     certain circumstances), and is transferable apart from the common
     stock ten days following a public announcement that a person or group
     has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
     common shares (which threshold may be reduced by the Board of
     Directors to as low as 10%), or ten business days following the
     commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender or
     exchange offer resulting in beneficial ownership by a person or group
     exceeding the threshold.
       Once the threshold has been exceeded, or if the Company is acquired
     in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Right will
     entitle the holder, other than such person or group, to purchase at
     the then current exercise price, stock of the Company or the acquiring
     company having a market value of twice the exercise price.
       Each Right is nonvoting and expires on December 28, 1998, unless
     redeemed by the Company, at a price of $.0025, at any time prior to
     the public announcement that a person or group has exceeded the
     threshold. At December 31, 1994, 2.1 million shares of the Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance under
     this plan.<PAGE>

     restrictions thereof as shall not be inconsistent with law or with
     this Article.

               Notwithstanding the fixing of the number of shares
     constituting a particular series upon the issuance thereof, the Board
     of Directors may at any time thereafter authorize the issuance of
     additional shares of the same series, or decrease the number of shares
     constituting such series (but not below the number of shares of such
     series then outstanding).

               (3)  All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock shall
     be identical with all other shares of the same series except that
     shares of any one series issued at different times may differ as to
     the dates from which dividends thereon shall be cumulative; and all
     series shall rank equally and be identical in all respects, except as
     permitted by the foregoing provisions of paragraph B. (2).

               (4)  (a)  The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled
     to receive cash dividends when and as declared by the Board of
     Directors at such rate per share per annum, cumulatively if so
     provided, and with such preferences, as shall have been fixed by the
     Board of Directors, before any dividends shall be paid upon or
     declared and set apart for the Common Stock or any other class of
     stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, and such dividends on
     each series of the Preferred Stock shall cumulate, if at all, from and
     after the dates fixed by the Board of Directors with respect to such
     cumulation.  Accrued dividends shall bear no interest.

                    (b)  If dividends on the Preferred Stock are not
     declared in full then dividends shall be declared ratably on all
     shares of stock of each series of equal preference in proportion to<PAGE>


     the respective unpaid cumulative dividends, if any, to the end of the
     then current dividend period.  No ratable distribution shall be
     declared or set apart for payment with respect to any series until
     accumulated dividends in arrears in full have been declared and paid
     on any series senior in preference.

                    (c)  Unless dividends on all outstanding shares of
     series of the Preferred Stock having cumulative dividend rights shall
     have been fully paid for all past dividend periods, and unless all
     required sinking fund payments, if any, shall have been made or
     provided for, no dividend (except a dividend payable in Common Stock
     or in any other class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock)
     shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for the Common Stock or
     any other class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock.

                    (d)  Subject to the foregoing provisions, the Board of
     Directors may declare and pay dividends on the Common Stock and on any
     class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, to the extent
     permitted by law.  After full dividends for the current dividend
     period, and, in the case of Preferred Stock having cumulative dividend
     rights after all prior dividends have been paid or declared and set
     apart for payment, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled,
     to the exclusion of the holders of the Preferred Stock, to all further
     dividends declared and paid in such current dividend period.

               (5)  In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding
     up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any
     payment or distribution of the assets of the Corporation shall be made
     to or set apart for the holders of shares of any class or classes of
     stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, the
     holders of the shares of each series of the Preferred Stock shall be
     entitled to receive payment of the amount per share fixed in the
     resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing
     for the issuance of the shares of such series, plus an amount equal to
     all dividends accrued thereon to the date of final distribution to
     such holders; but they shall be entitled to no further payment.  If,
     upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
     the assets of the Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable
     among the holders of the shares of the Preferred Stock shall be
     insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid, then
     such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among such
     holders ratably in accordance with the respective amount which would
     be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in
     full.  For the purposes of this paragraph B. (5), the sale,
     conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock,
     securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the
     property or assets of the Corporation or a consolidation or merger of
     the Corporation with one or more corporations shall not be deemed to
     be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.

               (6)  Shares of any series of Preferred Stock which have been
     issued and reacquired in any manner by the Company (excluding shares
     purchased and retired, whether through the operation of a retirement
     or sinking fund or otherwise, and shares which, if convertible or
     exchangeable, have been converted into or exchanged for shares of
     stock of any other class or classes) shall have the status of
     authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued
     as a part of the series of which they were originally a part or may be
     reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock
     or as part of any other series of Preferred Stock, all subject to the<PAGE>
     conditions or restrictions on issuance fixed by the Board of Directors
     with respect to the shares of any other series of Preferred Stock.

               (7)  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in
     the authorizing resolutions, none of the shares of any series of
     Preferred Stock shall be entitled to any voting rights and the Common
     Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of
     directors and for all other purposes.  So long as any shares of any
     series of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not,
     without the consent of the holders of a majority of the then
     outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, irrespective of series, either
     expressed in writing (to the extent permitted by law) or by their
     affirmative vote at a meeting called for that purpose: (i) adopt any
     amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or take any
     other action which in any material respect adversely affects any
     preference, power, special right, or other term of the Preferred Stock
     or the holders thereof, (ii) create or issue any class of stock
     entitled to any preference over the Preferred Stock as to the payment
     of dividends, or the distribution of capital assets, (iii) increase
     the aggregate number of shares constituting the authorized Preferred
     Stock or (iv) create or issue any other class of stock entitled to any
     preference on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to the payment of
     dividends or the distribution of capital assets.

               (8)  If in any case the amounts payable with respect to any
     obligations to retire shares of the Preferred Stock are not paid in
     full in the case of all series with respect to which such obligations
     exist, the number of shares of each of such series to be retired
     pursuant to any such obligations shall be in proportion to the
     respective amounts which would be payable on account of such
     obligations if all amounts payable in respect of such series were
     discharged in full.

               (9)  The shares of Preferred Stock may be issued by the
     Corporation from time to time for such consideration as may be fixed
     from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Any and all shares for
     which the consideration so fixed shall have been paid or delivered
     shall be deemed fully paid and nonassessable.

               (10) For the purpose of the provisions of this Article
     dealing with Preferred Stock or of any resolution of the Board of
     Directors providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock
     or of any certificate filed with the Secretary of State of the State
     of Delaware pursuant to any such resolution (unless otherwise provided
     in any such resolution or certificate):

                    (a)  The term "outstanding", when used in reference to
     shares of stock, shall mean issued shares, excluding shares held by
     the Corporation and shares called for redemption, funds for the
     redemption of which shall have been set aside or deposited in trust;

                    (b)  The amount of dividends "accrued" on any share of
     Preferred Stock as at any dividend date shall be deemed to be the
     amount of any unpaid dividends accumulated thereon to and including
     such dividend date, whether or not earned or declared, and the amount
     of dividends "accrued" on any share of Preferred Stock as at any date
     other than a dividend date shall be calculated as the amount of any
     unpaid dividends accumulated thereon to and including the last
     preceding dividend date, whether or not earned or declared, plus an
     amount equivalent to interest on the involuntary liquidation value of<PAGE>


     such share at the annual dividend rate fixed for the shares of such
     series for the period after such last preceding dividend date to and
     including the date as of which the calculation is made;

                    (c)  The term "class or classes of stock of the
     corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock" shall mean the
     Common Stock of the Corporation and any other class or classes of
     stock of the Corporation hereafter authorized which shall rank junior
     to the Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation.

                 C.  PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL CAPITAL STOCK

               No holder of any share or shares of any class of stock of
     the Corporation shall have any preemptive or preferential right to
     subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class of the
     Corporation now or hereafter authorized or any securities convertible
     into or carrying any rights to purchase any shares of stock of any
     class of the Corporation now or hereafter authorized, other than such
     rights, if any, as the Board of Directors in its discretion from time
     to time may grant, and at such prices and upon such other terms and
     conditions as the Board of Directors in its discretion may fix.

                         D.  SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK

               Following are the statements of the designations,
     preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
     rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of
     the series of Preferred Stock that have been designated by the Board
     of Directors as authorized herein:

               1.   Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

               RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and
     vested in the Board of Directors of this Corporation (hereinafter
     called the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") in accordance with the
     provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of
     Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, without par
     value (the "Preferred Stock"), of the Corporation and hereby states
     the designation and number of shares, and fixes the relative rights,
     preferences, and limitations thereof as follows:

               Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock:

               Section 1.  Designation and Amount.  The shares of such
     series shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred
     Stock" (the "Series A Preferred Stock") and the number of shares
     constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 2,050,000.  Such
     number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the
     Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number
     of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the number
     of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for
     issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants
     or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the
     Corporation convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

               (A)  Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of
     any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and
     superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,<PAGE>
     the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to
     the holders of Common Stock, without par value (the "Common Stock"),
     of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled
     to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of
     funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable
     in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in
     each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly
     Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend
     Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a
     share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to
     the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1 or (b) subject to the
     provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the
     aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the
     aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends
     or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of
     Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
     Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock
     since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or,
     with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the
     first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A
     Preferred Stock.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time
     declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
     Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation
     of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
     otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock)
     into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in
     each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A
     Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under
     clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying
     such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
     shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and
     the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that
     were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               (B)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or
     distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph
     (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or
     distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in
     shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or
     distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the
     period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next
     subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share
     on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such
     subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.

               (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on
     outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly
     Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares,
     unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date
     for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends
     on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such
     shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment
     Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of
     holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a
     quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in
     either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be
     cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but
     unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the
     shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total
     amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such<PAGE>
     shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all
     such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a
     record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A
     Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
     distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more
     than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series
     A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set
     forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder
     thereof to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the
     stockholders of the Corporation.  In the event the Corporation shall
     at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in
     shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or
     consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
     reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares
     of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
     Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which
     holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to
     such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction,
     the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
     outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which
     is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
     immediately prior to such event, provided that in no event shall a
     share of Series A Preferred Stock be entitled to more than one vote.

               (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other
     Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or
     any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A
     Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any
     other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights
     shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of
     stockholders of the Corporation.

               (C)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by
     law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting
     rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent
     they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth
     herein) for taking any corporate action.

               Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

               (A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or
     distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in
     Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid
     dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of
     Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the
     Corporation shall not:

               (i)   declare or pay dividends, or make any other
     distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to
     dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the
     Series A Preferred Stock;

               (ii)  declare or pay dividends, or make any other
     distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as
     to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the
     Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series<PAGE>
     A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are
     payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the
     holders of all such shares are then entitled;

               (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for
     consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to
     dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the
     Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any
     time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior
     stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking
     junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or
     winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or

               (iv)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for
     consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of
     stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in
     accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as
     determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares
     upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the
     respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and
     preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in
     good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the
     respective series or classes.

               (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the
     Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any
     shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under
     paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such
     shares at such time and in such manner.

               Section 5.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series A
     Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in
     any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after
     the acquisition thereof.  All such shares shall upon their
     cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock
     and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject
     to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in
     the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate
     of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar
     stock or as otherwise required by law.

               Section 6.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  Upon
     any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no
     distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock
     ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless,
     prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
     have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and
     unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared,
     to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of
     Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate
     amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter
     set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed
     per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders
     of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred
     Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred
     Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to
     which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  In the event the Corporation<PAGE>
     shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock
     payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or
     combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
     (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in
     shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of
     Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which
     holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled
     immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the
     preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a
     fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of
     which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
     immediately prior to such event.

               Section 7.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the
     Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or
     other transaction in which the shares of Common stock are exchanged
     for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other
     property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock
     shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an
     amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter
     set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock,
     securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the
     case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is
     changed or exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time
     declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
     Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation
     of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
     otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock)
     into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in
     each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with
     respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred
     Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the
     numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
     immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
     number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
     prior to such event.

               Section 8.  No Redemption.  The shares of Series A Preferred
     Stock shall not be redeemable.

               Section 9.  Rank.  The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank,
     with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of
     assets, junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's
     Preferred Stock.

               Section 10.  Amendment.  The Restated Certificate of
     Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner
     which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or
     special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them
     adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-
     thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting
     together as a single class.

               2.   Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock.

               RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to and
     vested in the Board of Directors of this Corporation (hereinafter
     called the "Board of Directors" or the "Board"), in accordance with
     the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board<PAGE>
     of Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, without par
     value (the "Preferred Stock"), of the Corporation and hereby states
     the designation and number of shares, and fixes the relative rights,
     preferences and limitations thereof as follows:

               Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock:

               Section 1.  Designation and Amount; Special Purpose
     Restricted Transfer Issue.

               (A)  The shares of such series shall be designated as
     "Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock" (the "Series B Preferred
     Stock") and the number of shares constituting the Series B Preferred
     Stock shall be 5,413,434.  Such number may be increased or decreased
     by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease
     shall reduce the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to a
     number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number
     of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding
     options, rights or warrants issued by, or upon the conversion of any
     outstanding securities issued by, the Corporation convertible into
     Series B Preferred Stock.

               (B)  Shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be issued
     (whether upon original issuance or upon transfer) only to a trustee or
     trustees (or to any successor trustee or trustees) (collectively, a
     "Trustee") acting under a trust agreement for the benefit of
     participants in one or more employee stock ownership plans or other
     employee benefit plans of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of the
     Corporation (any such plan, a "Plan").  In the event of a sale,
     distribution or other transfer (any such sale, distribution or other
     transfer, a "Transfer") of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock to
     any person or entity other than the Corporation or a Trustee, but
     excluding a distribution of such shares to participants or
     beneficiaries in a Plan pursuant to the terms thereof, the shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock which are the subject of a Transfer (the
     "Transferred Shares") shall be automatically converted into shares of
     the Corporation's Common Stock, without par value ("Common Stock") at
     the conversion rate provided in Section 5(A) hereof; provided,
     however, that in the event of a foreclosure or other realization upon
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock pledged as collateral by or
     pursuant to any credit agreement, indenture or other document or
     instrument for the financing or refinancing of the initial purchase of
     the Series B Preferred Stock by a Plan, the Transferred Shares shall
     be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock at the
     conversion rate provided in Section 5(B) hereof.  In the event of a
     Transfer of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock to any person or
     entity other than the Corporation or a Trustee in connection with a
     distribution of such shares to participants or beneficiaries in a Plan
     pursuant to the terms thereof, the Transferred Shares shall
     automatically be converted into Common Stock at the conversion rate
     provided in Section 5(B) hereof.  In each such case conversion will
     occur immediately upon such Transfer and without any further action by
     the Corporation or the holder of the Transferred Shares and thereafter
     (i) any certificates for Transferred Shares shall be deemed to
     represent the shares of Common Stock into which such Transferred
     Shares have been so converted, (ii) no holder of such Transferred
     Shares shall have any of the voting powers, preferences and relative,
     participating, optional or special rights of a holder of shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock, but, rather, only the powers and rights of a
     holder of the Common Stock into which such shares of Series B<PAGE>
     Preferred Stock shall be so converted and (iii) the holder of such
     Transferred Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of
     the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of
     such Transfer.  The pledge of Series B Preferred Stock as collateral
     by or pursuant to any credit agreement, indenture or other document or
     instrument for the financing or refinancing of the initial purchase of
     the Series B Preferred Stock by a Plan shall not constitute a Transfer
     for purposes of this Section 1(B), but the foreclosure or other
     realization upon such pledged shares shall constitute a Transfer.
     Certificates representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
     legended to reflect the restrictions on transfer set forth in this
     Section 1(B).  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
     Section 1(B), shares of Series B Preferred Stock (i) may be converted
     into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 or 6 hereof at any
     time prior to a Transfer and the shares of Common Stock issued upon
     such conversion will not be subject to any of the restrictions of this
     Section 1(B) and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Corporation upon the
     terms and conditions provided by Sections 7 and 8 hereof.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

               (A)  Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of
     any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and
     superior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,
     the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in preference to
     the holders of Common Stock and of any other Junior Stock (as defined
     in Section 2(D) hereof), shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if
     declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for
     the purpose, cumulative cash dividends payable in an amount per share
     equal to $.2515 per quarter and no more (such amount being referred to
     herein as the "Dividend Amount"), payable in arrears on the first day
     of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date
     being referred to herein as "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on
     the first Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share of
     Series B Preferred Stock.  In the event that any Dividend Payment Date
     shall occur on any day other than a "Business Day" (as defined in
     Section 9(F) hereof), the dividend payment due on such Dividend
     Payment Date shall be paid on the Business Day immediately preceding
     such Dividend Payment Date.  The Board of Directors may fix a record
     date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution
     declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days
     prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

               (B)  Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares
     of Series B Preferred Stock from the date of issue of such shares and
     shall accrue on a daily basis whether or not declared and whether or
     not the Corporation shall have earnings or surplus out of which such
     dividends could be paid at the time.  Dividends accrued on the shares
     of Series B Preferred Stock for any period less than a full quarterly
     period between Dividend Payment Dates shall be computed on the basis
     of a 360-day year of 30-day months. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall
     cumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become
     payable, but no interest shall accrue on accrued or accumulated but
     unpaid dividends.

               (C)  Dividends paid on the shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the<PAGE>
     time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on
     a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.

               (D)  So long as any Series B Preferred Stock shall be
     outstanding, no dividend shall be declared and paid or set apart for
     payment on any other series of stock ranking on a parity with the
     Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends ("Parity Stock"), unless
     there shall also be or have been declared and paid or set apart for
     payment on the Series B Preferred Stock dividends for all dividend
     payment periods of the Series B Preferred Stock ending on or before
     the dividend payment date of such Parity Stock, ratably in proportion
     to the respective amounts of dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock
     accumulated and unpaid through the most recent such dividend payment
     period, and accumulated and unpaid on such Parity Stock through the
     dividend payment period on such Parity Stock ending on such dividend
     payment date or such dividend payment date immediately preceding such
     dividend payment period. So long as any Series B Preferred Stock shall
     be outstanding, in the event that full cumulative dividends on the
     Series B Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid or set apart
     for payment when due, the Corporation shall not declare and pay or set
     apart for payment any dividends or make any other distributions on, or
     make any payment on account of the purchase, redemption or other
     retirement of, Common Stock or any other class of stock or series
     thereof of the Corporation ranking, as to dividends or as to
     distributions in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
     of the Corporation, junior to the Series B Preferred Stock
     (collectively, "Junior Stock") until full cumulative and unpaid
     dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall have been paid or
     declared and set apart for payment; provided, however, that the
     foregoing shall not apply to (i) any dividend payable solely in any
     shares of any Junior Stock, or (ii) the acquisition of shares of any
     Junior Stock either (x) pursuant to any employee or director incentive
     or benefit plan or arrangement of the Corporation or any subsidiary of
     the Corporation heretofore or hereafter adopted or (y) in exchange
     solely for shares of any other Junior Stock.  Subject to the foregoing
     provisions of this Section 2(D), the Board of Directors may declare
     and the Corporation may pay or set apart for payment dividends and
     other distributions on any other Junior Stock or Parity Stock, and may
     purchase or otherwise redeem or retire any of the Junior Stock or
     Parity Stock or any warrants, rights, or options or other securities
     exercisable for or convertible into any of the Junior Stock or Parity
     Stock and the holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall
     not be entitled to share therein.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series
     B Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (A)  Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall entitle
     the holder thereof to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of
     the stockholders of the Corporation; it being understood that whenever
     the "Conversion Ratio" (as defined in Section 5(A) hereof) is adjusted
     as provided in Section 9 hereof, the number of votes per share of
     Series B Preferred Stock shall also be similarly adjusted.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of votes per share of Series
     B Preferred Stock shall at no time exceed the highest number then
     permitted by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
     Corporation as then in effect or by applicable rules and regulations
     of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the New York Stock
     Exchange.  In the event that the number of votes per share of Series B
     Preferred Stock is not adjusted upon an adjustment to the Conversion<PAGE>
     Ratio as a result of the immediately preceding sentence, then the
     Board of Directors shall promptly take such action as may be necessary
     to equitably adjust for such adjustment to the Conversion Ratio,
     including without limitation, subdividing outstanding shares of Series
     B Preferred Stock (by declaring a stock dividend or otherwise) to the
     extent the Corporation has authorized shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock which are not then outstanding, or designating and issuing
     additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the extent the
     Corporation has authorized shares of Preferred Stock which are not
     then outstanding and are undesignated as to series; provided, however,
     no such action on the part of the Board of Directors shall adjust or
     change the aggregate economic terms assigned to the outstanding shares
     of Series B Preferred Shares.

               (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other
     Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or
     any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any
     other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights
     shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of
     stockholders of the Corporation.

               (C)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by
     law, holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no special voting
     rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent
     they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth
     herein) for taking any corporate action.  Any increase or decrease in
     the authorized class of Preferred Stock (but not below the number of
     shares thereof then outstanding) shall not be deemed to alter or
     change the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely within the
     meaning of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and no
     class vote shall be required to authorize such increase or decrease.

               (D)  If at any time dividends payable on the Series B
     Preferred Stock, or on any one or more other series of Preferred Stock
     of the Corporation entitled to receive cumulative preferred dividends,
     are in arrears and unpaid in an amount equal to or exceeding the
     amount of dividends payable on such Series B Preferred Stock and/or
     other series of Preferred Stock entitled to receive cumulative
     dividends for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not
     consecutive, the holders of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
     entitled to receive cumulative preferred dividends will have the
     exclusive right, voting separately as a class, to elect two directors
     to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the next annual
     meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the authorized number of
     Directors not to be increased for this purpose.  Such voting right
     will continue for such Preferred Stock until all dividends on the
     Series B Preferred Stock and on such other series have been paid in
     full, at which time such voting right of the holders of such Preferred
     Stock will terminate, subject to re-vesting in the event of a
     subsequent arrearage.  Upon any termination of the aforesaid voting
     right, the term of office of those directors elected by holders of
     Preferred Stock voting separately as a class will terminate.

               Section 4.  Liquidation, Dissolution.

               (A)  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of
     shares of stock ranking junior with respect to rights to receive<PAGE>
     distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up to the
     Series B Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares
     of Series B Preferred Stock shall have received an amount in cash of
     $14.375 per share (such amount being referred to herein as the
     "Liquidation Preference"), plus an amount in cash equal to accrued and
     unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared, up to the date of
     such payment, or (ii) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a
     parity with respect to the right to receive distributions upon
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up with the Series B Preferred
     Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series B Preferred
     Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to
     which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  After payment of the full
     amount to which they are entitled as provided by the foregoing
     provisions of this Section 4(A), the holders of shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further right or claim to
     any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.

               (B)  Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation
     with or into any other corporation or other entity, nor the merger or
     consolidation of any other corporation or other entity with or into
     the Corporation, nor the sale, transfer or lease of all or any portion
     of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of this
     Section 4, and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall
     nevertheless be entitled in the event of any such merger or
     consolidation to the rights provided by Section 8 hereof.

               (C)  Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the
     payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts
     distributable to holders of Series B Preferred Stock in such
     circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by hand delivery, by
     courier, by any standard form of telecommunication or by first-class
     mail, postage prepaid, delivered, sent or mailed (as the case may be)
     not less than twenty (20) days prior to any payment date stated
     therein, to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, at their
     respective addresses shown on the books of the Corporation or any
     transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock; provided, however,
     that a failure to give notice as provided above or any defect therein
     shall not affect the Corporation's ability to consummate a voluntary
     or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation.

               Section 5.  Conversion into Common Stock.

               (A)  A holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
     entitled, at any time prior to the close of business on the date fixed
     for redemption of such shares pursuant to Section 7 hereof, to cause
     any or all of such shares to be converted into validly issued, fully
     paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, initially at a
     conversion rate equal to the ratio of .7692 share of Common Stock for
     each one share of Series B Preferred Stock, which conversion rate
     shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided (and, as so adjusted,
     rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is hereinafter sometimes
     referred to as the "Conversion Ratio"); provided, however, that, if
     the shares of Common Stock have a par value, in no event shall the
     Conversion Ratio be greater than the Liquidation Preference divided by
     the par value of one share of Common Stock.<PAGE>

               (B)  Notwithstanding Section 5(A), in the event of an
     automatic conversion pursuant to Section 1(B) hereof due to a
     distribution of Series B Preferred Stock to participants or
     beneficiaries in a Plan or foreclosure or other realization upon
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock pledged as collateral by or
     pursuant to any credit agreement, indenture or other document or
     instrument for the financing or refinancing of the initial purchase of
     the Series B Preferred Stock by a Plan, shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock shall be converted into validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate, expressed
     as a ratio of shares of Common Stock per share of Series B Preferred
     Stock, equal to the greatest of: (i) the Conversion Ratio, (ii) a
     fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value (as
     defined in Section 9(F) hereof) of one share of Series B Preferred
     Stock (plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon,
     if such dividends have not already been taken into account in
     determining the Fair Market Value) and the denominator of which shall
     be the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, both computed
     as of the date of conversion, or (iii) the lesser of: (A) one share of
     Common Stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, adjusted
     accordingly with adjustments in the Conversion Ratio pursuant to
     Section 9 hereof, or (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
     the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
     dividends thereon and the denominator of which shall be the Fair
     Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of conversion.

               (C)  Any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
     desiring to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock shall
     surrender the certificate or certificates representing the shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock being converted, duly assigned or endorsed
     for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock
     powers relating thereto), at the principal executive office of the
     Corporation or the offices of the transfer agent for the Series B
     Preferred Stock or such office or offices in the continental United
     States of an agent for conversion as may from time to time be
     designated by notice to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock by
     the Corporation or the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred
     Stock, accompanied by written notice of conversion.  Such notice of
     conversion shall specify (i) the number of shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or names in which such
     holder wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be
     issued and for any shares of Series B Preferred Stock not to be so
     converted to be issued (subject to compliance with applicable legal
     requirements if any of said certificates are to be issued in a name
     other than the name of the holder), and (ii) the address to which such
     holder wishes delivery to be made of such new certificates to be
     issued upon such conversion.

               (D)  Upon surrender of a certificate representing a share or
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock for conversion, the Corporation or
     the transfer agent for the Common Stock shall, as promptly as
     practicable after such surrender, issue and deliver to the holder
     thereof or to such holder's designee, at the address designated by
     such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
     Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon conversion,
     together with any cash adjustment of any fraction of a share as
     hereinafter provided.  In the event that there shall have been
     surrendered a certificate or certificates representing shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be converted, the
     Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder or such holder's<PAGE>
     designee a new certificate or certificates representing the number of
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock which shall not have been
     converted.

               (E)  A conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into
     shares of Common Stock shall be effective (i) if made at the option of
     the holder thereof, as of the close of business on the day on which
     the Corporation receives written notice of conversion pursuant to
     Section 5(C) or (ii) if made pursuant to Section 1(B) hereof, at the
     time of Transfer.  On and after the effective date of conversion, the
     shares of Series B Preferred so converted shall no longer be deemed to
     be outstanding for any purpose, and the person or persons entitled to
     receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
     treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
     shares of Common Stock, but no allowance or adjustment shall be made
     in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record
     on any date prior to such effective date.  The Corporation shall not
     be obligated to pay any dividends which shall have been declared and
     shall be payable to holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock on a
     Dividend Payment Date if such Dividend Payment Date for such dividend
     shall be on or subsequent to the effective date of conversion of such
     shares, unless such declared dividends have been set aside for payment
     prior to the effective date of conversion of such shares, which
     dividends shall be paid on the applicable Dividend Payment Date.

               (F)  Whenever the Corporation shall issue shares of Common
     Stock upon conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as
     contemplated by this Section 5, the Corporation shall issue together
     with each such share of Common Stock one right to purchase Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation (or other
     securities in lieu thereof) pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as
     of December 13, 1988 between the Corporation and The First National
     Bank of Chicago, as Rights Agent, as such agreement may from time to
     time be amended (such Agreement, as so amended, is hereinafter
     referred to as the "Rights Agreement"), or any rights issued to
     holders of Common Stock in addition thereto or in replacement
     therefor, whether or not such rights shall be exercisable at such
     time, but only if such rights are issued and outstanding and held by
     other holders of Common Stock at such time and have not expired.

               Section 6.  Other Conversion Rights.  In addition to the
     conversion rights provided in Section 5(A) and 5(B) hereof, shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock
     at the option of the holder at any time and from time to time upon
     notice to the Corporation given not less than five (5) Business Days
     prior to the date fixed by the holder in such notice for such
     conversion, (A) when and to the extent necessary for such holder to
     provide for distributions required to be made under, or to satisfy an
     investment election provided to participants in accordance with, a
     Plan to participants in such Plan at a conversion rate, expressed as a
     ratio of shares of Common Stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock,
     equal to the greater of (i) the Conversion Ratio or (ii) a fraction,
     the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of one share of
     Series B Preferred Stock (plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to
     the date of conversion if such dividends have not already been taken
     into account in determining Fair Market Value) and the denominator of
     which shall be the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock,
     both computed as of the date of conversion, or (B) in the event that
     the Plan is determined by the Internal Revenue Service not to be
     qualified within the meaning of Sections 401(a) and 4975(e)(7) of the<PAGE>
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") at a conversion
     rate, expressed as a ratio of shares of Common Stock per share of
     Series B Preferred Stock, equal to the greatest of (i) a fraction, the
     numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of one share of
     Series B Preferred Stock plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
     dividends thereon (if such dividends have not already been taken into
     account in determining the Fair Market Value) and the denominator of
     which shall be the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock,
     both computed as of the date of conversion, (ii) a fraction, the
     numerator of which shall be the Liquidation Preference plus accrued
     but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of conversion and the
     denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of one share of
     Common Stock on the date of conversion or (iii) the Conversion Ratio.

               Section 7.  Redemption At the Option of the Corporation.

               (A)  The Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in
     whole or in part, at the option of the Corporation, out of funds
     legally available therefor, at any time after September 8, 1992, at
     the following redemption prices:

                                             Redemption Price As
          During the Twelve-Month            A Percentage of
          Period Beginning September 8       Liquidation Preference

     and thereafter at the Liquidation Preference, plus, in each case, an
     amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date
     fixed for redemption. Payment of the redemption price shall be made by
     the Corporation in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination
     thereof, as permitted by Section 7(E). From and after the close of
     business on the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption will cease to accrue,
     such shares will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights
     in respect of such shares of the Corporation shall cease, except the
     right to receive the redemption price; provided that shares of Series
     B Preferred Stock may be converted pursuant to Section 5 or, if
     applicable, Section 6 hereof at any time prior to the close of
     business on the date fixed for redemption of such shares pursuant to
     Section 7 or 8 hereof.  No interest shall accrue on the redemption
     price after the date fixed for redemption.  If less than all of the
     outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the
     Corporation shall select the shares to be redeemed in the manner
     determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

               (B)  Unless otherwise required by law, notice of redemption
     with respect to a redemption pursuant to paragraphs (A), (C) or (D) of
     this Section 7 will be sent to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock
     at the address shown on the books of the Corporation or any transfer
     agent for the Series B Preferred Stock by hand delivery, by courier,<PAGE>
     by any standard form of telecommunication or by first class mail,
     postage prepaid, delivered, sent or mailed (as the case may be) not
     less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the
     redemption date.  Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption
     date; (ii) the total number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock
     to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder
     are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such
     holder; (iii) the redemption price and method of payment therefor;
     (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be
     surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on
     the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption
     date; and (vi) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the
     period within which conversion rights may be exercised, and the
     Conversion Ratio in effect at the time.  Upon surrender of the
     certificates for any shares called for redemption pursuant to the
     provisions of this Section 7 or the provisions of Section 8 hereof,
     which shares have not previously been converted, such shares shall be
     redeemed by the Corporation at the date fixed for redemption and at
     the applicable redemption price set forth in this Section 7 or in
     Section 8 hereof.

               (C)  In the event (i) of a change in the federal tax law of
     the United States of America or a determination by a court of
     competent jurisdiction, which, in either case, has the effect of
     precluding the Corporation from claiming any of the tax deductions for
     dividends paid on the Series B Preferred Stock when such dividends are
     used as provided under Section 404(k)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code
     of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and in effect on the date shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock are initially issued, or (ii) that shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock are held by an employee benefit plan intended
     to qualify as an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of
     Section 4975 of the Code, as amended, and such plan is determined by
     the Internal Revenue Service not to qualify, the Corporation may, in
     its sole discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
     Section 7(A), elect to redeem such shares, out of funds legally
     available therefor, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)
     the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
     dividends or (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Series B
     Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption if such dividends
     have not already been taken into account in determining Fair Market
     Value, and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in
     Sections 7(A) and 7(B).

               (D)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
     7(A), the Corporation may elect to redeem any or all of the shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock at any time on or prior to September 8, 1992,
     out of funds legally available therefor, at a redemption price equal
     to the greater of (i) the applicable redemption price specified in
     Section 7(A) hereof plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
     dividends, or (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Series B
     Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption if such dividends
     have not already been taken into account in determining Fair Market
     Value, and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in Sections
     7(A) and 7(B), if the Corporation terminates an employee stock
     ownership plan or employee benefit plan pursuant to which shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock are then held by a Trustee (in which case
     only the shares held pursuant to such plan may be so redeemed).<PAGE>

               (E)  The Corporation, at its option, may make payment of the
     redemption price required upon redemption of shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a
     combination of such shares and cash, any such shares to be valued for
     such purpose at their Fair Market Value as of the date of redemption.

               Section 8.  Consolidation, Combination, Merger, etc.

               (A)  In the event that the Corporation shall consummate any
     exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger,
     combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other transaction
     pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by
     operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or
     converted solely into, stock of any successor or resulting company
     (including the Corporation) that constitutes "qualifying employer
     securities" with respect to a holder of Series B Preferred Stock
     within the meaning of Section 409(a) of the Code and Section 407 (d)
     (5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
     amended, or any successor provisions of law (together, if applicable,
     with a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares), the shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock of such holder shall in connection therewith
     be assumed by and shall become preferred stock of such successor or
     resulting company, having in respect of such company insofar as
     possible the same powers, preferences and relative, participating,
     optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights
     provided by Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof), and the qualifications,
     limitations or restrictions thereon, that the Series B Preferred Stock
     had immediately prior to such transaction, except that after such
     transaction each share of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be
     convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section
     5 or 6 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer
     securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common
     Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have
     been converted pursuant to Section 5(A) hereof immediately prior to
     such transaction or, if Section 5(B) or 6 hereof is thereafter
     applicable, into the kind of qualifying employer securities so
     receivable by a holder of one share of Common Stock and the number of
     such shares determined pursuant to Section 5(B) or 6; provided,
     however, that if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a
     holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to
     the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transac-
     tion, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the
     Series B Preferred Stock, then such election shall be deemed to be
     solely for "qualifying employer securities" (together, if applicable,
     with a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) with the effect
     provided above on the basis of the number and kind of qualifying
     employer securities receivable by a holder of the number of shares of
     Common Stock into which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock could
     have been converted pursuant to Section 5(A) hereof immediately prior
     to such transaction or if Section 5(B) or 6 hereof is thereafter
     applicable, into the kind of qualifying employer securities receivable
     by a holder of one share of Common Stock and the number of such shares
     determined pursuant to Section 5(B) or 6 (it being understood that if
     the kind or amount of qualifying employer securities receivable in
     respect of each share of Common Stock upon such transaction is not the
     same for each such share, then the kind and amount of qualifying
     employer securities deemed to be receivable in respect of each share
     of Common Stock for purposes of this proviso shall be the kind and
     amount so receivable per share of Common Stock by a plurality of such
     shares).  The rights of the Series B Preferred Stock as preferred<PAGE>
     stock of such successor or resulting company shall successively be
     subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 9 hereof after any such
     transaction as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments
     provided for by such Section prior to such transaction.  The
     Corporation shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or
     similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of the Series B
     Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or
     resulting company pursuant to this Section 8(A).

               (B)  In the event that the Corporation shall consummate any
     exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger,
     combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other transaction,
     pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by
     operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted
     into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any
     combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is
     constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to
     in Section 8(A)) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of
     fractional shares, outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock
     shall, without any action on the part of the Corporation or any holder
     thereof (but subject to Section 8(C)), be automatically converted by
     virtue of such merger, consolidation, combination or similar business
     combination transaction immediately prior to its consummation into the
     number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each
     share of Series B Preferred Stock, shall, by virtue of such
     transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
     Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of
     stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind)
     receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into
     which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have been
     converted pursuant to Section 5(A) hereof immediately prior to such
     transaction; provided, however, that if by virtue of the structure of
     such transaction a holder of Common Stock is required to make an
     election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be
     received in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be
     made by the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, then the shares
     of Series B Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and
     on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be
     converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of such stock,
     securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a
     holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares
     of Series B Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately
     prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock had elected
     to receive the maximum amount of qualifying employer securities
     offered (it being understood that if the kind or amount of stock,
     securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is
     not the same for each share which so elected the maximum amount of
     qualifying employer securities, then the kind and amount of stock,
     securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction
     for each such share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per
     share by a plurality of the shares which so elected the maximum amount
     of qualifying employer securities).

               (C)  In the event the Corporation shall enter into any
     agreement providing for any exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer,
     consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization
     or other transaction, described in Section 8(B), then the Corporation
     shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least ten
     (10) Business Days before consummation of such transaction) give<PAGE>
     notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder
     of Series B Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right
     to elect, by written notice to the Corporation, to receive, upon
     consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is
     consummated), out of funds legally available therefor, from the
     Corporation or the successor of the Corporation, in redemption and
     retirement of such Series B Preferred Stock, a cash payment equal to
     the redemption price specified in Section 7(A) hereof in effect on the
     date set for redemption plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     dividends.  No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless
     given to the Corporation prior to the close of business on the
     Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the
     Corporation or the successor of the Corporation shall waive such prior
     notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may
     be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Corporation prior to
     the close of business on the Business Day prior to consummation of
     such transaction.

               Section 9.  Anti-Dilution Adjustments.

               (A)  (i)  Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock
     are outstanding, (x) pay a dividend or make a distribution in respect
     of the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock or (y) subdivide the
     outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, in
     each case whether by reclassification of shares, recapitalization of
     the Corporation, a recapitalization or reclassification effected by a
     merger, consolidation or other transaction to which Section 8 hereof
     applies or otherwise, then, in such event, the Board of Directors
     shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a dividend in
     respect of the Series B Preferred Stock in shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock (a "Special Dividend") in such a manner that a holder
     of Series B Preferred Stock will become the holder of that number of
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the product of the number
     of such shares held prior to such event times a fraction (the "Sec.
     9(A) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction"), the numerator of which is the
     number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
     event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding immediately before such event.  A Special Dividend
     declared pursuant to this Section 9(A)(i) shall be effective upon
     payment of such dividend or distribution in respect of the Common
     Stock and in the case of a subdivision shall become effective
     immediately as of the effective date thereof.  Concurrently with the
     declaration of the Special Dividend pursuant to this paragraph
     9(A)(i), the Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount of all
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount, respectively, in
     effect immediately before such event by the Sec. 9(A) Non-Dilutive
     Share Fraction.

                    (ii)  The Corporation and the Board of Directors shall
     each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all
     actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate for declaration of
     the Special Dividend provided in paragraph 9(A)(i) but shall not be
     required to call a special meeting of stockholders in order to
     implement the provisions thereof.  If for any reason the Board of
     Directors is precluded from giving full effect to the Special Dividend
     provided in paragraph 9(A)(i), then no such Special Dividend shall be
     declared, but instead the Conversion Ratio shall automatically be<PAGE>
     adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately
     before the event by the Sec. 9(A) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, and the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount will not be adjusted.
     An adjustment to the Conversion Ratio made pursuant to this paragraph
     9(A)(ii) shall be given effect upon payment of such a dividend or
     distribution as of the record date for the determination of holders
     entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (on a retroactive
     basis) and in the case of a subdivision shall become effective
     immediately as of the effective date thereof.  If subsequently the
     Board of Directors is able to give full effect to the Special Dividend
     as provided in paragraph 9(A)(i), then such Special Dividend will be
     declared in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(A)(i) and
     the adjustment in the Conversion Ratio as provided in this paragraph 9
     (A)(ii) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively.

                    (iii) Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock
     are outstanding, combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
     lesser number of shares, whether by reclassification of shares,
     recapitalization of the Corporation, a recapitalization or
     reclassification effected by a merger, consolidation or other
     transaction to which Section 8 hereof applies or otherwise, then, in
     such event, the Conversion Ratio shall automatically be adjusted by
     multiplying the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately before such
     event by the Sec. 9(A) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, and the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount will not be adjusted.
     An adjustment to the Conversion Ratio made pursuant to this paragraph
     9(A)(iii) shall be given effect immediately as of the effective date
     of such combination.

               (B)  (i)   Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     (E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
     outstanding, issue, sell or exchange shares of Common Stock (other
     than pursuant to (x) any right or warrant to purchase or acquire
     shares of Common Stock (including as such a right or warrant any
     security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock),
     (y) the Rights Agreement or (z) any employee or director incentive,
     compensation or benefit plan or arrangement of the Corporation or any
     subsidiary of the Corporation heretofore or hereafter adopted) for a
     consideration having a Fair Market Value on the date of issuance, sale
     or exchange less than the Fair Market Value of such shares on the date
     of issuance, sale or exchange, then, in such event, the Board of
     Directors shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a Special
     Dividend in such a manner that a holder of Series B Preferred Stock
     will become the holder of that number of shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock equal to the product of the number of such shares held prior to
     such event times a fraction (the "Sec. 9(B)(i) Non-Dilutive Share
     Fraction"), the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding immediately before the public announcement of such
     issuance, sale or exchange plus the number of shares of Common Stock
     so issued, sold or exchanged by the Corporation and the denominator of
     which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
     before the public announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange plus
     the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at the
     Fair Market Value of the consideration received by the Corporation in
     respect of such issuance, sale or exchange.  A Special Dividend
     declared pursuant to this Section 9(B)(i) shall be effective upon such
     issuance, sale or exchange.  Concurrently with the declaration of the<PAGE>
     Special Dividend pursuant to this Section 9(B)(i), the Liquidation
     Preference and the Dividend Amount of all shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Liquidation Preference and the
     Dividend Amount, respectively, in effect immediately before such
     issuance, sale or exchange by the Sec. 9(B)(i) Non-Dilutive Share
     Fraction.

                    (ii)  Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
     outstanding issue, sell or exchange any right or warrant to purchase
     or acquire shares of Common Stock (including as such a right or
     warrant any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
     Common Stock and rights issued under the Rights Agreement), other than
     any such issuance to holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend
     or distribution (including by way of a reclassification of shares or a
     recapitalization of the Corporation) and other than pursuant to any
     employee or director incentive, compensation or benefit plan or
     arrangement of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation
     heretofore or hereafter adopted, exercisable for a consideration
     having a Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of
     such issuance, sale or exchange less than the Sec. 9(F) Non-Dilutive
     Amount (as defined in Section 9(F) (vi)), then in such event, the
     Board of Directors shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a
     Special Dividend in such a manner that a holder of Series B Preferred
     Stock will become the holder of that number of shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock equal to the product of the number of such shares held
     prior to such event times a fraction (the "Sec. 9 (B)(ii) Non-Dilutive
     Share Fraction"), the numerator of which is the number of shares of
     Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or
     warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that could
     be acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and warrants and
     the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
     outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants
     plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at
     the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of such
     issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise
     in full of all such rights or warrants and any other amounts paid in
     connection with such issuance of rights or warrants.  A Special
     Dividend declared pursuant to this Section 9(B)(ii) shall be effective
     upon such issuance, sale or exchange.  Concurrently with the
     declaration of the Special Dividend pursuant to this Section 9(B)(ii),
     the Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount of all shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Liquidation
     Preference and the Dividend Amount, respectively, in effect
     immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants by the Section
     9(B)(ii) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction.

                    (iii) The Corporation and the Board of Directors shall
     each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all
     actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate for declaration of
     the Special Dividend provided in Sections 9(B)(i) and (ii) but shall
     not be required to call a special meeting of stockholders in order to
     implement the provisions hereof.  In the event for any reason the
     Board of Directors is precluded from giving full effect to the Special
     Dividend provided in Section 9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii), then no such Special
     Dividend shall be declared, but instead the Conversion Ratio shall
     automatically be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in
     effect immediately before such issuance of shares, rights or warrants
     by the Sec. 9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, as the<PAGE>
     case may be, and the Liquidation Preference and Dividend Amount will
     not be adjusted.  If subsequently the Board of Directors is able to
     give full effect to the Special Dividend as provided in Section
     9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii), then such Special Dividend will be declared in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii), as the
     case may be, and the adjustment in the Conversion Ratio as provided in
     this Section 9(B)(iii) will automatically be reversed and nullified
     prospectively.

               (C)  (i)   Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
     outstanding, make an Extraordinary Distribution (as hereinafter
     defined) in respect of the Common Stock, whether by dividend,
     distribution, reclassification of shares or recapitalization of the
     Corporation (including a recapitalization or reclassification effected
     by a transaction to which Section 8 hereof does not apply) or effect a
     Pro Rata Repurchase (as hereinafter defined) of Common Stock, then, in
     such event, the Board of Directors shall, to the extent legally
     permissible, declare a Special Dividend in such a manner that a holder
     of Series B Preferred Stock will become the holder of that number of
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the product of the number
     of such shares held prior to such event times a fraction (the "Sec.
     9(C) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction"), the numerator of which is the
     product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
     immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata
     Repurchase minus, in the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase, the number of
     shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Corporation multiplied by
     (y) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Valuation
     Date (as defined in Section 9(F) (viii)) with respect to an
     Extraordinary Distribution or on the expiration date (including all
     extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase
     or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase
     which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, and the denominator
     of which is (x) the product of (I) the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution
     or Pro Rata Repurchase multiplied by (II) the Fair Market Value of a
     share of Common Stock on the Valuation Date with respect to an
     Extraordinary Distribution, or on the expiration date (including all
     extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata
     Repurchase, or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata
     Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, minus (y)
     the Fair Market Value of the Extraordinary Distribution or the
     aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, as the case may
     be.  The Corporation shall send each holder of Series B Preferred
     Stock (x) notice of its intent to make any Extraordinary Distribution
     and (y) notice of any offer by the Corporation to make a Pro Rata
     Repurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as
     practicable after, such offer is first communicated to holders of
     Common Stock or the record date for such dividend is announced in
     accordance with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common
     Stock is listed or admitted to trading, as the case may be. Such
     notice shall indicate the intended record date and the amount and
     nature of such dividend or distribution, or the number of shares
     subject to such offer for a Pro Rata Repurchase and the purchase price
     payable by the Corporation pursuant to such offer, as well as the
     Conversion Ratio.  A Special Dividend declared pursuant to this
     Section 9(C)(i) shall be effective upon payment of any Extraordinary
     Distribution, the expiration date (including all extensions thereof)
     of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase or on the date of<PAGE>
     purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender
     offer, as the case may be. Concurrently with the declaration of the
     Special Dividend pursuant to this Section 9(C)(i), the Liquidation
     Preference and the Dividend Amount of all shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Liquidation Preference and the
     Dividend Amount, respectively, in effect immediately before such
     Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Sec. 9(C)
     Non-Dilutive Share Fraction.

                    (ii)  The Corporation and the Board of Directors shall
     each use its best efforts to take all reasonably necessary steps or to
     take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for the declaration
     of the Special Dividend provided in Section 9(C)(i) but shall not be
     required to call a special meeting of stockholders in order to
     implement the provisions hereof.  In the event for any reason the
     Board of Directors is precluded from giving full effect to the Special
     Dividend provided in Section 9(C)(i), then no such Special Dividend
     shall be declared, but instead the Conversion Ratio shall
     automatically be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in
     effect immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata
     Repurchase by the Sec. 9(C) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, and the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount will not be adjusted.
     If subsequently the Board of Directors is able to give full effect to
     the Special Dividend as provided in Section 9(C)(i), then such Special
     Dividend will be declared in accordance with the provisions of Section
     9(C)(i) and the adjustment in the Conversion Price as provided in this
     Section 9(C)(ii) will automatically be reversed and nullified
     prospectively.

               (D)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 9,
     the Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the
     Conversion Ratio unless such adjustment would require an increase or
     decrease equal to at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Ratio
     prior to such adjustment.  Any lesser adjustment shall be carried
     forward and shall be made no later than the time of, and together
     with, the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any
     adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an
     increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion
     Ratio.  All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the
     nearest one-hundredth of a cent or the nearest one-ten thousandth of a
     share, as the case may be.

               (E)  If the Corporation shall make any dividend or
     distribution of the Common Stock or issue any Common Stock, other
     capital stock or other equity security of the Corporation or any
     rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such security or any
     other transaction related to or having an impact upon its Common Stock
     or the Series B Preferred Stock, which transaction does not result in
     an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio pursuant to the foregoing
     provisions of this Section 9, the Board of Directors of the
     Corporation shall consider whether such action is of such a nature
     that it adversely affects the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock
     and that an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio, the provisions of
     Section 5(B) or 6, or a subdivision or combination of the outstanding
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock into a greater or lesser number of
     such shares should equitably be made in respect of such transaction.
     If in such case the Board of Directors of the Corporation in its sole
     discretion determines that an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio, the
     provisions of Section 5(B) or 6, or a subdivision or combination of
     the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock into a greater or<PAGE>
     lesser number of such shares should be made, such adjustment,
     subdivision or combination shall be made effective as of such date as
     determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  The
     determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation as to
     whether an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio, the provisions of
     Section 5(B) or a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares
     of Series B Preferred Stock into a greater or lesser number of such
     shares should be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
     Section 9(E), and, if so, as to what adjustment, subdivision or
     combination should be made, and when, shall be final and binding on
     the Corporation and all stockholders of the Corporation.  The
     Corporation shall be entitled to make such additional adjustment in
     the Conversion Ratio and the provisions of Section 5(B), in addition
     to those required by the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, as
     shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in
     shares of capital stock of the Corporation, subdivision,
     reclassification or combination of shares of stock of the Corporation
     or any recapitalization of the Corporation shall not be taxable to
     holders of the Common Stock.

               (F)  For purposes of this resolution, the following
     definitions shall apply:

                    (i)   "Business Day" shall mean each day that is not a
     Saturday, Sunday or a date on which federally or state chartered
     banking institutions in Chicago, Illinois or New York, New York are
     required or authorized to be closed.

                    (ii)  "Extraordinary Distribution" shall mean any
     dividend or other distribution (effected while any of the shares of
     Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding) of (x) cash, where the
     aggregate amount of such cash dividend or distribution together with
     the amount of all cash dividends and distributions made during the
     preceding 12 months, when combined with the aggregate amount of all
     Pro Rata Repurchases (for this purpose, including only that portion of
     the aggregate purchase price of each such Pro Rata Repurchase which is
     in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock repurchased as
     determined in accordance with Section 9(C)(i)), exceeds ten percent
     (10%) of the aggregate Fair Market Value of all shares of Common Stock
     outstanding on the record date for determining the shareholders
     entitled to receive such Extraordinary Distribution and/or (y) any
     shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than shares of
     Common Stock), other securities of the Corporation, evidences of
     indebtedness of the Corporation or any other person or any other
     property (including shares of any subsidiary of the Corporation), or
     any combination thereof.  The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary
     Distribution for purposes of Section 9(C) shall be equal to the sum of
     the Fair Market Value of such Extraordinary Distribution as of the
     date made.

                    (iii) "Fair Market Value" shall mean, as to shares of
     Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the
     Corporation or any other issuer which are publicly traded, the average
     of the "Current Market Prices" of such shares or such securities for
     each day of the Adjustment Period.  The "Fair Market Value" of any
     security which is not publicly traded or of any other property shall
     mean the fair value thereof as determined by an independent investment
     banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such
     securities or property selected in good faith by the Board of
     Directors of the Corporation or a committee thereof (which may be the<PAGE>
     independent appraiser engaged by any Plan) based on principles
     consistently applied, or, if no such investment banking or appraisal
     firm is in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or such
     committee available to make such determination, as determined in good
     faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or such committee.

                    (iv)  "Current Market Price" of publicly traded shares
     of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or other security
     of the Corporation or any other issuer for any day shall mean the last
     reported sales price, regular way, or, in case no such reported sale
     takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and
     asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the New York
     Stock Exchange Composite Tape, or, if such security is not listed or
     admitted to trading on such Exchange, on the principal national
     securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to
     trading, or if not listed or admitted to trading on any national
     securities exchange, on the National Association of Securities Dealers
     Automated Quotations National Market System, or, if such security is
     not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange
     or quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing
     bid and asked prices in the over-the-counter market as furnished by
     any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by
     the Board of Directors or a committee thereof for such purpose, in
     each case, on each trading day during the Adjustment Period.

                    (v)   "Adjustment Period" shall mean the period of five
     (5) consecutive trading days preceding, and including, the date as of
     which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.

                    (vi)  "Sec. 9(F) Non-Dilutive Amount" in respect of an
     issuance, sale or exchange by the Corporation of any right or warrant
     to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock (including any security
     convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) shall
     mean (x) the product of (I) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common
     Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public
     announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange and (II) the maximum
     number of shares of Common Stock which could be acquired on such date
     upon the exercise in full of such rights and warrants (including upon
     the conversion or exchange of all such convertible or exchangeable
     securities), whether or not exercisable (or convertible or
     exchangeable) at such date, minus (y) the aggregate amount payable
     pursuant to such right or warrant to purchase or acquire such maximum
     number of shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that in no event
     shall the Sec. 9(F) Non-Dilutive Amount be less than zero. For
     purposes of the foregoing sentence, in the case of a security
     convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, the
     amount payable pursuant to a right or warrant to purchase or acquire
     shares of Common Stock shall be the Fair Market Value of such security
     on the date of the issuance, sale or exchange of such security by the
     Corporation.

                    (vii) "Pro Rata Repurchase" shall mean any purchase of
     shares of Common Stock by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof,
     whether for cash, shares of capital stock of the Corporation, other
     securities of the Corporation, evidences of indebtedness of the
     Corporation or any other person or any other property (including
     shares of a subsidiary of the Corporation), or any combination
     thereof, effected while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
     are outstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer
     subject to Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act, or any successor<PAGE>
     provision of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to
     substantially all holders of Common Stock; provided, however, that no
     purchase of shares by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof made
     in open market transactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata Repurchase.
     For purposes of this Section 9(F) (vii), shares shall be deemed to
     have been purchased by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof "in
     open market transactions" if they have been purchased substantially in
     accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in effect under the
     Exchange Act, on the date shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
     initially issued by the Corporation or on such other terms and
     conditions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a committee
     thereof shall have determined are reasonably designed to prevent such
     purchases from having a material effect on the trading market for the
     Common Stock.

                    (viii) "Valuation Date" with respect to an Extraordi-
     nary Distribution shall mean the day immediately preceding (i) the ex-
     dividend date for such Extraordinary Distribution with respect to a
     security listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) the record
     date for such Extraordinary Distribution with respect to a security
     which is not listed on a national securities exchange.

               Section 10.  Retirement of Shares.  Any shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of the
     conversion or redemption of such shares as provided hereby, or
     otherwise so acquired, shall be cancelled as shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock and restored to the status of authorized but unissued
     shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, undesignated as to
     series, and may thereafter be reissued as part of a new series of
     Preferred Stock as permitted by law.

               Section 11.  Miscellaneous.

               (A)  All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and
     all notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon the
     earlier of receipt thereof or three (3) Business Days after the
     mailing thereof if sent by registered mail (unless first-class mail
     shall be specifically permitted for such notice under the terms of
     this Certificate) with postage prepaid, addressed: (i) if to the
     Corporation, to its office at McDonald's Plaza, Oak Brook, Illinois
     60521 (Attention: Secretary) or to the transfer agent for the Series B
     Preferred Stock, or other agent of the Corporation designated as
     permitted by this Certificate or (ii) if to any holder of the Series B
     Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, to such holder at
     the address of such holder as listed in the stock record books of the
     Corporation (which may include the records of any transfer agent for
     the Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be) or
     (iii) to such other address as the Corporation or any such holder, as
     the case may be, shall have designated by notice similarly given.

               (B)  In the event that, at any time as a result of an
     adjustment made pursuant to Section 9, the holder of any share of the
     Series B Preferred Stock upon surrendering such shares for conversion
     shall become entitled to receive any shares or other securities of the
     Corporation other than shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Ratio in
     respect of such other shares or securities so receivable upon
     conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
     adjusted, and shall be subject to further adjustment from time to
     time, in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to
     the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in Section 9<PAGE>
     hereof, and the provisions of each of the other Sections hereof with
     respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to
     any such other shares or securities.

               (C)  The Corporation shall pay any and all stock transfer
     and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect of any
     issuance or delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or shares
     of Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Series B
     Preferred Stock pursuant hereto or certificates representing such
     shares or securities.  The Corporation shall not, however, be required
     to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
     involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock or Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in
     which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock with respect to which
     such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were
     registered, or in respect of any payment to any person with respect to
     any such shares or securities other than a payment to the registered
     holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance,
     delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to
     such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Corporation the
     amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
     Corporation, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

               (D)  In the event that a holder of shares of Series B
     Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in
     which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such
     shares should be registered or to whom payment upon redemption of
     shares of Series B Preferred Stock should be made or the address to
     which the certificate or certificates representing such shares, or
     such payment, should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to
     register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the holder
     of such Series B Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the
     Corporation and to send the certificate or certificates representing
     such shares, or such payment, to the address of such holder shown on
     the records of the Corporation.

               (E)  Unless otherwise provided in this Certificate of
     Designation, as the same may be amended, all payments in the form of
     dividends, distributions on voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
     liquidation or winding-up or otherwise made upon the shares of Series
     B Preferred Stock and any other stock ranking on a parity with the
     Series B Preferred Stock with respect to such dividend or distribution
     shall be made pro rata, so that amounts paid per share on the Series B
     Preferred Stock and such other stock shall in all cases bear to each
     other the same ratio that the required dividends, distributions or
     payments, as the case may be, then payable per share on the shares of
     the Series B Preferred Stock and such other stock bear to each other.

               (F)  The Corporation may appoint, and from time to time
     discharge and change, a transfer agent for the Series B Preferred
     Stock.  Upon any such appointment or discharge of a transfer agent,
     the Corporation shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage
     prepaid, to each holder of record of Series B Preferred Stock.

               3.   Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock.

               RESOLVED, that the issue of a new series of Preferred Stock
     (the "Preferred Stock") without par value of the Corporation is hereby
     authorized and the designation, number of shares, relative rights,<PAGE>
     preferences and powers, and the qualifications, limitations and
     restrictions thereof, are hereby fixed as follows:

               Section 1.  Designation and Amount; Special Purpose
     Restricted Transfer Issue.

               (A)  The shares of such series shall be designated as
     "Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock" (the "Series C Preferred
     Stock") and the number of shares constituting the Series C Preferred
     Stock shall be 5,936,054.  Such number may be increased or decreased
     by resolution of the Board of Directors (hereinafter called the "Board
     of Directors" or the "Board"); provided, that no decrease shall reduce
     the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to a number less than
     the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares
     reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights
     or warrants issued by, or upon the conversion of any outstanding
     securities issued by, the Corporation convertible into Series C
     Preferred Stock.

               (B)  Shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be issued
     (whether upon original issuance or upon transfer) only to a trustee or
     trustees (or to any successor trustee or trustees) (collectively, a
     "Trustee") acting under a trust agreement for the benefit of
     participants in one or more employee stock ownership plans or other
     employee benefit plans of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of the
     Corporation (any such plan, a "Plan").  In the event of a sale,
     distribution or other transfer (any such sale, distribution or other
     transfer, a "Transfer") of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock to
     any person or entity other than the Corporation or a Trustee, but
     excluding a distribution of such shares to participants or
     beneficiaries in a Plan pursuant to the terms thereof, the shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock which are the subject of a Transfer (the
     "Transferred Shares") shall be automatically converted into shares of
     the Corporation's Common Stock, without par value ("Common Stock") at
     the conversion rate provided in Section 5(A) hereof; provided,
     however, that in the event of a foreclosure or other realization upon
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock pledged as collateral by or
     pursuant to any credit agreement, indenture or other document or
     instrument for the financing or refinancing of the initial purchase of
     the Series C Preferred Stock by a Plan, the Transferred Shares shall
     be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock at the
     conversion rate provided in Section 5(B) hereof.  In the event of a
     Transfer of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock to any person or
     entity other than the Corporation or a Trustee in connection with a
     distribution of such shares to participants or beneficiaries in a Plan
     pursuant to the terms thereof, the Transferred Shares shall
     automatically be converted into Common Stock at the conversion rate
     provided in Section 5(B) hereof.  In each such case conversion will
     occur immediately upon such Transfer and without any further action by
     the Corporation or the holder of the Transferred Shares and thereafter
     (i) any certificates for Transferred Shares shall be deemed to
     represent the shares of Common Stock into which such Transferred
     Shares have been so converted, (ii) no holder of such Transferred
     Shares shall have any of the voting powers, preferences and relative,
     participating, optional or special rights of a holder of shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock, but, rather, only the powers and rights of a
     holder of the Common Stock into which such shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock shall be so converted and (iii) the holder of such
     Transferred Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of
     the shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series C<PAGE>
     Preferred Stock have been automatically converted as of the date of
     such Transfer.  The pledge of Series C Preferred Stock as collateral
     by or pursuant to any credit agreement, indenture or other document or
     instrument for the financing or refinancing of the initial purchase of
     the Series C Preferred Stock by a Plan shall not constitute a Transfer
     for purposes of this Section 1(B), but the foreclosure or other
     realization upon such pledged shares shall constitute a Transfer.
     Certificates representing shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
     legended to reflect the restrictions on transfer set forth in this
     Section 1(B). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
     1(B), shares of Series C Preferred Stock (i) may be converted into
     shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 or 6 hereof at any time
     prior to a Transfer and the shares of Common Stock issued upon such
     conversion will not be subject to any of the restrictions of this
     Section 1(B) and (ii) shall be redeemable by the Corporation upon the
     terms and conditions provided by Sections 7 and 8 hereof.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

               (A)  Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of
     any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and
     superior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,
     the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, in preference to
     the holders of Common Stock and of any other Junior Stock (as defined
     in Section 2(D) hereof), shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if
     declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for
     the purpose, cumulative cash dividends payable in an amount per share
     equal to $.2898 per quarter and no more (such amount being referred to
     herein as the "Dividend Amount"), payable in arrears on the first day
     of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date
     being referred to herein as "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on
     the first Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share of
     Series C Preferred Stock.  In the event that any Dividend Payment Date
     shall occur on any day other than a "Business Day" (as defined in
     Section 9(F) hereof), the dividend payment due on such Dividend
     Payment Date shall be paid on the Business Day immediately preceding
     such Dividend Payment Date.  The Board of Directors may fix a record
     date for the determination of holders of shares of Series C Preferred
     Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution
     declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days
     prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

               (B)  Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares
     of Series C Preferred Stock from the date of issue of such shares and
     shall accrue on a daily basis whether or not declared and whether or
     not the Company shall have earnings or surplus out of which such
     dividends could be paid at the time.  Dividends accrued on the shares
     of Series C Preferred Stock for any period less than a full quarterly
     period between Dividend Payment Dates shall be computed on the basis
     of a 360-day year of 30-day months. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall
     cumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become
     payable, but no interest shall accrue on accrued or accumulated but
     unpaid dividends.

               (C)  Dividends paid on the shares of Series C Preferred
     Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the
     time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on
     a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.<PAGE>

               (D)  So long as any Series C Preferred Stock shall be
     outstanding, no dividend shall be declared and paid or set apart for
     payment on any other series of stock ranking on a parity with the
     Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends ("Parity Stock"), unless
     there shall also be or have been declared and paid or set apart for
     payment on the Series C Preferred Stock dividends for all dividend
     payment periods of the Series C Preferred Stock ending on or before
     the dividend payment date of such Parity Stock, ratably in proportion
     to the respective amounts of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock
     accumulated and unpaid through the most recent such dividend payment
     period, and accumulated and unpaid on such Parity Stock through the
     dividend payment period on such Parity Stock ending on such dividend
     payment date or such dividend payment date immediately preceding such
     dividend payment period.  So long as any Series C Preferred Stock
     shall be outstanding, in the event that full cumulative dividends on
     the Series C Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid or set
     apart for payment when due, the Corporation shall not declare and pay
     or set apart for payment any dividends or make any other distributions
     on, or make any payment on account of the purchase, redemption or
     other retirement of, Common Stock or any other class of stock or
     series thereof of the Corporation ranking, as to dividends or as to
     distributions in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
     of the Corporation, junior to the Series C Preferred Stock
     (collectively, "Junior Stock") until full cumulative and unpaid
     dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock shall have been paid or
     declared and set apart for payment; provided, however, that the
     foregoing shall not apply to (i) any dividend payable solely in any
     shares of any Junior Stock, or (ii) the acquisition of shares of any
     Junior Stock either (x) pursuant to any employee or director incentive
     or benefit plan or arrangement of the Corporation or any subsidiary of
     the Corporation heretofore or hereafter adopted or (y) in exchange
     solely for shares of any other Junior Stock.  Subject to the foregoing
     provisions of this Section 2(D), the Board of Directors may declare
     and the Corporation may pay or set apart for payment dividends and
     other distributions on any other Junior Stock or Parity Stock, and may
     purchase or otherwise redeem or retire any of the Junior Stock or
     Parity Stock or any warrants, rights, or options or other securities
     exercisable for or convertible into any of the Junior Stock or Parity
     Stock and the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock shall
     not be entitled to share therein.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series
     C Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (A)  Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall entitle
     the holder thereof to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of
     the stockholders of the Corporation; it being understood that whenever
     the "Conversion Ratio" (as defined in Section 5(A) hereof) is adjusted
     as provided in Section 9 hereof, the number of votes per share of
     Series C Preferred Stock shall also be similarly adjusted.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of votes per share of Series
     C Preferred Stock shall at no time exceed the highest number then
     permitted by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
     Corporation as then in effect or by applicable rules and regulations
     of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the New York Stock
     Exchange.  In the event that the number of votes per share of Series C
     Preferred Stock is not adjusted upon an adjustment to the Conversion
     Ratio as a result of the immediately preceding sentence, then the
     Board of Directors shall promptly take such action as may be necessary
     to equitably adjust for such adjustment to the Conversion Ratio,<PAGE>
     including without limitation, subdividing outstanding shares of Series
     C Preferred Stock (by declaring a stock dividend or otherwise) to the
     extent the Corporation has authorized shares of Series C Preferred
     Stock which are not then outstanding, or designating and issuing
     additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the extent the
     Corporation has authorized shares of Preferred Stock which are not
     then outstanding and are undesignated as to series; provided, however,
     no such action on the part of the Board of Directors shall adjust or
     change the aggregate economic terms assigned to the outstanding shares
     of Series C Preferred Stock.

               (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other
     Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or
     any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any
     other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights
     shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of
     stockholders of the Corporation.

               (C)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by
     law, holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall have no special voting
     rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent
     they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth
     herein) for taking any corporate action.  Any increase or decrease in
     the authorized class of Preferred Stock (but not below the number of
     shares thereof then outstanding) shall not be deemed to alter or
     change the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely within the
     meaning of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and no
     class vote shall be required to authorize such increase or decrease.

               (D)  If at any time dividends payable on the Series C
     Preferred Stock, or on any one or more other series of Preferred Stock
     of the Corporation entitled to receive cumulative preferred dividends,
     are in arrears and unpaid in an amount equal to or exceeding the
     amount of dividends payable on such Series C Preferred Stock and/or
     other series of Preferred Stock entitled to receive cumulative
     dividends for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not
     consecutive, the holders of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock
     entitled to receive cumulative preferred dividends will have the
     exclusive right, voting separately as a class, to elect two directors
     to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the next annual
     meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the authorized number of
     Directors not to be increased for this purpose.  Such voting right
     will continue for such Preferred Stock until all dividends on the
     Series C Preferred Stock and on such other series have been paid in
     full, at which time such voting right of the holders of such Preferred
     Stock will terminate, subject to re-vesting in the event of a
     subsequent arrearage.  Upon any termination of the aforesaid voting
     right, the term of office of those directors elected by holders of
     Preferred Stock voting separately as a class will terminate.

               Section 4.  Liquidation, Dissolution.

               (A)  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of
     shares of stock ranking junior with respect to rights to receive
     distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation to the Series C Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the
     holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have received an<PAGE>
     amount in cash of $16.5625 per share (such amount being referred to
     herein as the "Liquidation Preference"), plus an amount in cash equal
     to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared, up
     to the date of such payment, or (ii) to the holders of shares of stock
     ranking on a parity with respect to the right to receive distributions
     upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation with
     the Series C Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the
     Series C Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to
     the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled
     upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  After payment of
     the full amount to which they are entitled as provided by the
     foregoing provisions of this Section 4(A), the holders of shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further right or
     claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.

               (B)  Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation
     with or into any other corporation or other entity, nor the merger or
     consolidation of any other corporation or other entity with or into
     the Corporation, nor the sale, transfer or lease of all or any portion
     of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of this
     Section 4, and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall
     nevertheless be entitled in the event of any such merger or
     consolidation to the rights provided by Section 8 hereof.

               (C)  Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the
     payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts
     distributable to holders of Series C Preferred Stock in such
     circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by hand delivery, by
     courier, by any standard form of telecommunication or by first-class
     mail, postage prepaid, delivered, sent or mailed (as the case may be)
     not less than twenty (20) days prior to any payment date stated
     therein, to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, at their
     respective addresses shown on the books of the Corporation or any
     transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock; provided, however,
     that a failure to give notice as provided above or any defect therein
     shall not affect the Corporation's ability to consummate a voluntary
     or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation.

               Section 5.  Conversion into Common Stock.

               (A)  A holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
     entitled, at any time prior to the close of business on the date fixed
     for redemption of such shares pursuant to Section 7 hereof, to cause
     any or all of such shares to be converted into validly issued, fully
     paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, initially at a
     conversion rate equal to the ratio of .8000 share of Common Stock for
     each one share of Series C Preferred Stock, which conversion rate
     shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided (and, as so adjusted,
     rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is hereinafter sometimes
     referred to as the "Conversion Ratio"); provided, however, that, if
     the shares of Common Stock have a par value, in no event shall the
     Conversion Ratio be greater than the Liquidation Preference divided by
     the par value of one share of Common Stock.

               (B)  Notwithstanding Section 5(A), in the event of an
     automatic conversion pursuant to Section 1(B) hereof due to a
     distribution of Series C Preferred Stock to participants or<PAGE>
     beneficiaries in a Plan or foreclosure or other realization upon
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock pledged as collateral by or
     pursuant to any credit agreement, indenture or other document or
     instrument for the financing or refinancing of the initial purchase of
     the Series C Preferred Stock by a Plan, shares of Series C Preferred
     Stock shall be converted into validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate, expressed
     as a ratio of shares of Common Stock per share of Series C Preferred
     Stock, equal to the greatest of: (i) the Conversion Ratio, (ii) a
     fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market value (as
     defined in Section 9(F) hereof) of one share of Series C Preferred
     Stock (plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon,
     if such dividends have not already been taken into account in
     determining the Fair Market Value) and the denominator of which shall
     be the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, both computed
     as of the date of conversion, or (iii) the lesser of: (A) one share of
     Common Stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, adjusted
     accordingly with adjustments in the Conversion Ratio pursuant to
     Section 9 hereof, or (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
     the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
     dividends thereon and the denominator of which shall be the Fair
     Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of conversion.

               (C)  Any holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock
     desiring to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock shall
     surrender the certificate or certificates representing the shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock being converted, duly assigned or endorsed
     for transfer to the Corporation (or accompanied by duly executed stock
     powers relating thereto), at the principal executive office of the
     Corporation or the offices of the transfer agent for the Series C
     Preferred Stock or such office or offices in the continental United
     States of an agent for conversion as may from time to time be
     designated by notice to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock by
     the Corporation or the transfer agent for the Series C Preferred
     Stock, accompanied by written notice of conversion.  Such notice of
     conversion shall specify (i) the number of shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or names in which such
     holder wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be
     issued and for any shares of Series C Preferred Stock not to be so
     converted to be issued (subject to compliance with applicable legal
     requirements if any of said certificates are to be issued in a name
     other than the name of the holder), and (ii) the address to which such
     holder wishes delivery to be made of such new certificates to be
     issued upon such conversion.

               (D)  Upon surrender of a certificate representing a share or
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock for conversion, the Corporation or
     the transfer agent for the Common Stock shall, as promptly as
     practicable after such surrender, issue and deliver to the holder
     thereof or to such holder's designee, at the address designated by
     such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of
     Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled upon conversion,
     together with any cash adjustment of any fraction of a share as
     hereinafter provided.  In the event that there shall have been
     surrendered a certificate or certificates representing shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be converted, the
     Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder or such holder's
     designee a new certificate or certificates representing the number of
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock which shall not have been
     converted.<PAGE>

               (E)  A conversion of shares of Series C Preferred Stock into
     shares of Common Stock shall be effective (i) if made at the option of
     the holder thereof, as of the close of business on the day on which
     the Corporation receives written notice of conversion pursuant to
     Section 5(C) or (ii) if made pursuant to Section 1(B) hereof, at the
     time of Transfer.  On and after the effective date of conversion, the
     shares of Series C Preferred so converted shall no longer be deemed to
     be outstanding for any purpose, and the person or persons entitled to
     receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
     treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
     shares of Common Stock, but no allowance or adjustment shall be made
     in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record
     on any date prior to such effective date.  The Corporation shall not
     be obligated to pay any dividends which shall have been declared and
     shall be payable to holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock on a
     Dividend Payment Date if such Dividend Payment Date for such dividend
     shall be on or subsequent to the effective date of conversion of such
     shares, unless such declared dividends have been set aside for payment
     prior to the effective date of conversion of such shares, which
     dividends shall be paid on the applicable Dividend Payment Date.

               (F)  Whenever the Corporation shall issue shares of Common
     Stock upon conversion of shares of Series C Preferred Stock as
     contemplated by this Section 5, the Corporation shall issue together
     with each such share of Common Stock one right to purchase Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation (or other
     securities in lieu thereof) pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as
     of December 13, 1988 between the Corporation and The First National
     Bank of Chicago, as Rights Agent, as such agreement has been, and may
     from time to time be, amended (such Agreement, as so amended, is
     hereinafter referred to as the "Rights Agreement"), or any rights
     issued to holders of Common Stock in addition thereto or in
     replacement therefor, whether or not such rights shall be exercisable
     at such time, but only if such rights are issued and outstanding and
     held by other holders of Common Stock at such time and have not
     expired.

               Section 6.  Other Conversion Rights.  In addition to the
     conversion rights provided in Section 5(A) and 5(B) hereof, shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock
     at the option of the holder at any time and from time to time upon
     notice to the Corporation given not less than five (5) Business Days
     prior to the date fixed by the holder in such notice for such
     conversion, (A) when and to the extent necessary for such holder to
     provide for distributions required to be made under, or to satisfy an
     investment election provided to participants in accordance with, a
     Plan, to participants in such Plan at a conversion rate, expressed as
     a ratio of shares of Common Stock per share of Series C Preferred
     Stock, equal to the greater of (i) the Conversion Ratio or (ii) a
     fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of one
     share of Series C Preferred Stock (plus accrued and unpaid dividends
     thereon to the date of conversion if such dividends have not already
     been taken into account in determining Fair Market Value) and the
     denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of one share of
     Common Stock, both computed as of the date of conversion, or (B) in
     the event that the Plan is determined by the Internal Revenue Service
     not to be qualified within the meaning of Sections 401(a) and
     4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
     "Code"), at a conversion rate, expressed as a ratio of shares of<PAGE>
     Common Stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock, equal to the
     greatest of (i) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair
     Market Value of one share of Series C Preferred Stock plus an amount
     equal to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (if such dividends have
     not already been taken into account in determining the Fair Market
     Value) and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value of
     one share of Common Stock, both computed as of the date of conversion,
     (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Liquidation
     Preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of
     conversion and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value
     of one share of Common Stock on the date of conversion or (iii) the
     Conversion Ratio.

               Section 7.  Redemption at the Option of the Corporation.

               (A)  The Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemable, in
     whole or in part, at the option of the Corporation, out of funds
     legally available therefor, at any time after April 1, 1994, at the
     following redemption prices:

                                             Redemption Price As
          During the Twelve-Month            A Percentage of
          Period Beginning April 1           Liquidation Preference
          ------------------------           ----------------------
                  1991                             107.0
                  1992                             106.3
                  1993                             105.6
                  1994                             104.9
                  1995                             104.2
                  1996                             103.5
                  1997                             102.8
                  1998                             102.1
                  1999                             101.4
                  2000                             100.7

     and thereafter at the Liquidation Preference, plus in each case, an
     amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date
     fixed for redemption.  Payment of the redemption price shall be made
     by the Corporation in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination
     thereof, as permitted by Section 7(E).  From and after the close of
     business on the date fixed for redemption, dividends on shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock called for redemption will cease to accrue,
     such shares will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights
     in respect of such shares of the Corporation shall cease, except the
     right to receive the redemption price; provided that shares of Series
     C Preferred Stock may be converted pursuant to Section 5 or, if
     applicable, Section 6 hereof at any time prior to the close of
     business on the date fixed for redemption of such shares pursuant to
     Section 7 or 8 hereof.  No interest shall accrue on the redemption
     price after the date fixed for redemption.  If less than all of the
     outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the
     Corporation shall select the shares to be redeemed in the manner
     determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

               (B)  Unless otherwise required by law, notice of redemption
     with respect to a redemption pursuant to paragraphs (A), (C) or (D) of
     this Section 7 will be sent to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock
     at the address shown on the books of the Corporation or any transfer
     agent for the Series C Preferred Stock by hand delivery, by courier,
     by any standard form of telecommunication or by first class mail,<PAGE>
     postage prepaid, delivered, sent or mailed (as the case may be) not
     less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the
     redemption date.  Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption
     date; (ii) the total number of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
     to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder
     are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such
     holder; (iii) the redemption price and method of payment therefor;
     (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be
     surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) that dividends on
     the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption
     date; and (vi) the conversion rights of the shares to be redeemed, the
     period within which conversion rights may be exercised, and the
     Conversion Ratio in effect at the time.  Upon surrender of the
     certificates for any shares called for redemption pursuant to the
     provisions of this Section 7 or the provisions of Section 8 hereof,
     which shares have not previously been converted, such shares shall be
     redeemed by the Corporation at the date fixed for redemption and at
     the applicable redemption price set forth in this Section 7 or in
     Section 8 hereof.

               (C)  In the event (i) of a change in the federal tax law of
     the United States of America or a determination by a court of
     competent jurisdiction, which, in either case, has the effect of
     precluding the Corporation from claiming any of the tax deductions for
     dividends paid on the Series C Preferred Stock when such dividends are
     used as provided under Section 404(k)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code
     of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and in effect on the date shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock are initially issued, or (ii) that shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock are held by an employee benefit plan intended
     to qualify as an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of
     Section 4975 of the Code, as amended, and such plan is determined by
     the Internal Revenue Service not to qualify, the Corporation may, in
     its sole discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
     Section 7(A), elect to redeem such shares, out of funds legally
     available therefor, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)
     the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
     dividends or (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Series C
     Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption if such dividends
     have not already been taken into account in determining Fair Market
     Value, and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in Sections
     7(A) and 7(B).

               (D)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
     7(A), the Corporation may elect to redeem any or all of the shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock at any time on or prior to April 1, 1994, out
     of funds legally available therefor, at a redemption price equal to
     the greater of (i) the applicable redemption price specified in
     Section 7(A) hereof plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
     dividends, or (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Series C
     Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption if such dividends
     have not already been taken into account in determining Fair Market
     Value, and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in Sections
     7(A) and 7(B), if the Corporation terminates an employee stock
     ownership plan or employee benefit plan pursuant to which shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock are then held by a Trustee (in which case
     only the shares held pursuant to such plan may be so redeemed).<PAGE>

               (E)  The Corporation, at its option, may make payment of the
     redemption price required upon redemption of shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a
     combination of such shares and cash, any such shares to be valued for
     such purpose at their Fair Market Value as of the date of redemption.

               Section 8.  Consolidation, Combination, Merger, etc.

               (A)  In the event that the Corporation shall consummate any
     exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger,
     combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other transaction
     pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by
     operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or
     converted solely into, stock of any successor or resulting company
     (including the Corporation) that constitutes "qualifying employer
     securities" with respect to a holder of Series C Preferred Stock
     within the meaning of Section 409(a) of the Code and Section 407(d)(5)
     of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or
     any successor provisions of law (together, if applicable, with a cash
     payment in lieu of fractional shares), the shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock of such holder shall in connection therewith be
     assumed by and shall become preferred stock of such successor or
     resulting company, having in respect of such company insofar as
     possible the same powers, preferences and relative, participating,
     optional or other special rights (including the redemption rights
     provided by Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof), and the qualifications,
     limitations or restrictions thereon, that the Series C Preferred Stock
     had immediately prior to such transaction, except that after such
     transaction each share of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be
     convertible, otherwise on the terms and conditions provided by Section
     5 or 6 hereof, into the number and kind of qualifying employer
     securities so receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common
     Stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could have
     been converted pursuant to Section 5(A) hereof immediately prior to
     such transaction or, if Section 5(B) or 6 hereof is thereafter
     applicable, into the kind of qualifying employer securities so
     receivable by a holder of one share of Common Stock and the number of
     such shares determined pursuant to Section 5(B) or 6; provided,
     however, that if by virtue of the structure of such transaction, a
     holder of Common Stock is required to make an election with respect to
     the nature and kind of consideration to be received in such transac-
     tion, which election cannot practicably be made by the holders of the
     Series C Preferred Stock, then such election shall be deemed to be
     solely for "qualifying employer securities" (together, if applicable,
     with a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) with the effect
     provided above on the basis of the number and kind of qualifying
     employer securities receivable by a holder of the number of shares of
     Common Stock into which the shares of Series C Preferred Stock could
     have been converted pursuant to Section 5(A) hereof immediately prior
     to such transaction or if Section 5(B) or 6 hereof is thereafter
     applicable, into the kind of qualifying employer securities receivable
     by a holder of one share of Common Stock and the number of such shares
     determined pursuant to Section 5(B) or 6 (it being understood that if
     the kind or amount of qualifying employer securities receivable in
     respect of each share of Common Stock upon such transaction is not the
     same for each such share, then the kind and amount of qualifying
     employer securities deemed to be receivable in respect of each share
     of Common Stock for purposes of this proviso shall be the kind and
     amount so receivable per share of Common Stock by a plurality of such
     shares).  The rights of the Series C Preferred Stock as preferred<PAGE>
     stock of such successor or resulting company shall successively be
     subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 9 hereof after any such
     transaction as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments
     provided for by such Section prior to such transaction.  The
     Corporation shall not consummate any such merger, consolidation or
     similar transaction unless all then outstanding shares of the Series C
     Preferred Stock shall be assumed and authorized by the successor or
     resulting company pursuant to this Section 8(A).

               (B)  In the event that the Corporation shall consummate any
     exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger,
     combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other transaction,
     pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by
     operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted
     into other stock or securities or cash or any other property, or any
     combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is
     constituted solely of qualifying employer securities (as referred to
     in Section 8(A)) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of
     fractional shares, outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock
     shall, without any action on the part of the Corporation or any holder
     thereof (but subject to Section 8(C)), be automatically converted by
     virtue of such merger, consolidation, combination or similar business
     combination transaction immediately prior to its consummation into the
     number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time so that each
     share of Series C Preferred Stock, shall, by virtue of such
     transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common
     Stock, be converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of
     stock, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind)
     receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into
     which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could have been
     converted pursuant to Section 5(A) hereof immediately prior to such
     transaction; provided, however, that if by virtue of the structure of
     such transaction a holder of Common Stock is required to make an
     election with respect to the nature and kind of consideration to be
     received in such transaction, which election cannot practicably be
     made by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, then the shares
     of Series C Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and
     on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be
     converted into or exchanged for the aggregate amount of such stock,
     securities, cash or other property (payable in kind) receivable by a
     holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares
     of Series C Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately
     prior to such transaction if such holder of Common Stock had elected
     to receive the maximum amount of qualifying employer securities
     offered (it being understood that if the kind or amount of stock,
     securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction is
     not the same for each share which so elected the maximum amount of
     qualifying employer securities, then the kind and amount of stock,
     securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction
     for each such share shall be the kind and amount so receivable per
     share by a plurality of the shares which so elected the maximum amount
     of qualifying employer securities).

               (C)  In the event the Corporation shall enter into any
     agreement providing for any exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer,
     consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization
     or other transaction, described in Section 8(B), then the Corporation
     shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least ten
     (10) Business Days before consummation of such transaction) give<PAGE>
     notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder
     of Series C Preferred Stock and each such holder shall have the right
     to elect, by written notice to the Corporation, to receive, upon
     consummation of such transaction (if and when such transaction is
     consummated), out of funds legally available therefor, from the
     Corporation or the successor of the Corporation, in redemption and
     retirement of such Series C Preferred Stock, a cash payment equal to
     the redemption price specified in Section 7(A) hereof in effect on the
     date set for redemption plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid
     dividends.  No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless
     given to the Corporation prior to the close of business on the
     Business Day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the
     Corporation or the successor of the Corporation shall waive such prior
     notice, but any notice of redemption so given prior to such time may
     be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Corporation prior to
     the close of business on the Business Day prior to consummation of
     such transaction.

               Section 9.  Anti-Dilution Adjustments.

               (A)  (i)   Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
     are outstanding, (x) pay a dividend or make a distribution in respect
     of the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock or (y) subdivide the
     outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, in
     each case whether by reclassification of shares, recapitalization of
     the Corporation, a recapitalization or reclassification effected by a
     merger, consolidation or other transaction to which Section 8 hereof
     applies or otherwise, then, in such event, the Board of Directors
     shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a dividend in
     respect of the Series C Preferred Stock in shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock (a "Special Dividend") in such a manner that a holder
     of Series C Preferred Stock will become the holder of that number of
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock equal to the product of the number
     of such shares held prior to such event times a fraction (the "Sec.
     9(A) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction"), the numerator of which is the
     number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
     event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding immediately before such event.  A Special Dividend
     declared pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(i) shall be effective upon
     payment of such dividend or distribution in respect of the Common
     Stock and in the case of a subdivision shall become effective
     immediately as of the effective date thereof.  Concurrently with the
     declaration of the Special Dividend pursuant to this paragraph
     9(A)(i), the Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount of all
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount, respectively, in
     effect immediately before such event by the Sec. 9(A) Non-Dilutive
     Share Fraction.

                    (ii)  The Corporation and the Board of Directors shall
     each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all
     actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate for declaration of
     the Special Dividend provided in paragraph 9(A)(i) but shall not be
     required to call a special meeting of stockholders in order to
     implement the provisions thereof.  If for any reason the Board of
     Directors is precluded from giving full effect to the Special Dividend
     provided in paragraph 9(A)(i), then no such Special Dividend shall be
     declared, but instead the Conversion Ratio shall automatically be<PAGE>
     adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately
     before the event by the Sec. 9(A) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, and the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount will not be adjusted.
     An adjustment to the Conversion Ratio made pursuant to this paragraph
     9(A)(ii) shall be given effect upon payment of such a dividend or
     distribution as of the record date for the determination of holders
     entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (on a retroactive
     basis) and in the case of a subdivision shall become effective
     immediately as of the effective date thereof.  If subsequently the
     Board of Directors is able to give full effect to the Special Dividend
     as provided in paragraph 9(A)(i), then such Special Dividend will be
     declared in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(A)(i) and
     the adjustment in the Conversion Ratio as provided in this paragraph
     9(A)(ii) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively.

                    (iii) Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock
     are outstanding, combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
     lesser number of shares, whether by reclassification of shares,
     recapitalization of the Corporation, a recapitalization or
     reclassification effected by a merger, consolidation or other
     transaction to which Section 8 hereof applies or otherwise, then, in
     such event, the Conversion Ratio shall automatically be adjusted by
     multiplying the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately before such
     event by the Sec. 9(A) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, and the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount will not be adjusted.
     An adjustment to the Conversion Ratio made pursuant to this paragraph
     9(A)(iii) shall be given effect immediately as of the effective date
     of such combination.

               (B)  (i)   Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     (E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
     outstanding, issue, sell or exchange shares of Common Stock (other
     than pursuant to (x) any right or warrant to purchase or acquire
     shares of Common Stock (including as such a right or warrant any
     security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock),
     (y) the Rights Agreement or (z) any employee or director incentive,
     compensation or benefit plan or arrangement of the Corporation or any
     subsidiary of the Corporation heretofore or hereafter adopted) for a
     consideration having a Fair Market Value on the date of issuance, sale
     or exchange less than the Fair Market Value of such shares on the date
     of issuance, sale or exchange, then, in such event, the Board of
     Directors shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a Special
     Dividend in such a manner that a holder of Series C Preferred Stock
     will become the holder of that number of shares of Series C Preferred
     Stock equal to the product of the number of such shares held prior to
     such event times a fraction (the "Sec. 9(B)(i) Non-Dilutive Share
     Fraction"), the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding immediately before the public announcement of such
     issuance, sale or exchange plus the number of shares of Common Stock
     so issued, sold or exchanged by the Corporation and the denominator of
     which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
     before the public announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange plus
     the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at the
     Fair Market Value of the consideration received by the Corporation in
     respect of such issuance, sale or exchange.  A Special Dividend
     declared pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(i) shall be effective upon
     such issuance, sale or exchange.  Concurrently with the declaration of<PAGE>
     the Special Dividend pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(i), the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount of all shares of Series
     C Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Liquidation
     Preference and the Dividend Amount, respectively, in effect
     immediately before such issuance, sale or exchange by the Sec. 9(B)(i)
     Non-Dilutive Share Fraction.

                    (ii)  Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
     outstanding issue, sell or exchange any right or warrant to purchase
     or acquire shares of Common Stock (including as such a right or
     warrant any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
     Common Stock and rights issued under the Rights Agreement), other than
     any such issuance to holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend
     or distribution (including by way of a reclassification of shares or a
     recapitalization of the Corporation) and other than pursuant to any
     employee or director incentive, compensation or benefit plan or
     arrangement of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation
     heretofore or hereafter adopted, exercisable for a consideration
     having a Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of
     such issuance, sale or exchange less than the Sec. 9(F) Non-Dilutive
     Amount (as defined in paragraph 9(F)(vi)), then in such event, the
     Board of Directors shall, to the extent legally permissible, declare a
     Special Dividend in such a manner that a holder of Series C Preferred
     Stock will become the holder of that number of shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock equal to the product of the number of such shares held
     prior to such event times a fraction (the "Sec. 9(B)(ii) Non-Dilutive
     Share Fraction"), the numerator of which is the number of shares of
     Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or
     warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that could
     be acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and warrants and
     the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
     outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants
     plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at
     the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of such
     issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise
     in full of all such rights or warrants and any other amounts paid in
     connection with such issuance of rights or warrants.  A Special
     Dividend declared pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(ii) shall be
     effective upon such issuance, sale or exchange.  Concurrently with the
     declaration of the Special Dividend pursuant to this paragraph
     9(B)(ii), the Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount of all
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount, respectively, in
     effect immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants by the
     Sec. 9(B)(ii) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction.

                    (iii) The Corporation and the Board of Directors shall
     each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all
     actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate for declaration of
     the Special Dividend provided in paragraphs 9(B)(i) and 9(B)(ii) but
     shall not be required to call a special meeting of stockholders in
     order to implement the provisions hereof.  In the event for any reason
     the Board of Directors is precluded from giving full effect to the
     Special Dividend provided in paragraphs 9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii), then no
     such Special Dividend shall be declared, but instead the Conversion
     Ratio shall automatically be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion
     Ratio in effect immediately before such issuance of shares, rights or
     warrants by the Sec. 9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction,<PAGE>
     as the case may be, and the Liquidation Preference and Dividend Amount
     will not be adjusted.  If subsequently the Board of Directors is able
     to give full effect to the Special Dividend as provided in paragraphs
     9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii), then such Special Dividend will be declared in
     accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 9(B)(i) or 9(B)(ii), as
     the case may be, and the adjustment in the Conversion Ratio as
     provided in this paragraph 9(B)(iii) will automatically be reversed
     and nullified prospectively.

               (C)  (i)   Subject to the provisions of Sections 9(D) and
     9(E) hereof, in the event the Corporation shall, at any time or from
     time to time while any of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
     outstanding, make an Extraordinary Distribution (as hereinafter
     defined) in respect of the Common Stock, whether by dividend,
     distribution, reclassification of shares or recapitalization of the
     Corporation (including a recapitalization or reclassification effected
     by a transaction to which Section 8 hereof does not apply) or effect a
     Pro Rata Repurchase (as hereinafter defined) of Common Stock, then, in
     such event, the Board of Directors shall, to the extent legally
     permissible, declare a Special Dividend in such a manner that a holder
     of Series C Preferred Stock will become the holder of that number of
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock equal to the product of the number
     of such shares held prior to such event times a fraction (the "Sec.
     9(C) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction"), the numerator of which is the
     product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
     immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata
     Repurchase minus, in the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase, the number of
     shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Corporation multiplied by
     (y) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Valuation
     Date (as defined in paragraph 9(F)(viii)) with respect to an
     Extraordinary Distribution or on the expiration date (including all
     extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase
     or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase
     which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, and the denominator
     of which is (x) the product of (I) the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution
     or Pro Rata Repurchase multiplied by (II) the Fair Market Value of a
     share of Common Stock on the Valuation Date with respect to an
     Extraordinary Distribution, or on the expiration date (including all
     extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata
     Repurchase, or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata
     Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, minus (y)
     the Fair Market Value of the Extraordinary Distribution or the
     aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, as the case may
     be.  The Corporation shall send each holder of Series C Preferred
     Stock (x) notice of its intent to make any Extraordinary Distribution
     and (y) notice of any offer by the Corporation to make a Pro Rata
     Repurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as
     practicable after, such offer is first communicated to holders of
     Common Stock or the record date for such dividend is announced in
     accordance with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common
     Stock is listed or admitted to trading, as the case may be. Such
     notice shall indicate the intended record date and the amount and
     nature of such dividend or distribution, or the number of shares
     subject to such offer for a Pro Rata Repurchase and the purchase price
     payable by the Corporation pursuant to such offer, as well as the
     Conversion Ratio.  A Special Dividend declared pursuant to this
     paragraph 9(C)(i) shall be effective upon payment of any Extraordinary
     Distribution, the expiration date (including all extensions thereof)
     of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase or on the date of<PAGE>
     purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender
     offer, as the case may be. Concurrently with the declaration of the
     Special Dividend pursuant to this paragraph 9(C)(i), the Liquidation
     Preference and the Dividend Amount of all shares of Series C Preferred
     Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Liquidation Preference and the
     Dividend Amount, respectively, in effect immediately before such
     Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Sec. 9(C)
     Non-Dilutive Share Fraction.

                    (ii)  The Corporation and the Board of Directors shall
     each use its best efforts to take all reasonably necessary steps or to
     take all actions as are necessary or appropriate for the declaration
     of the Special Dividend provided in paragraph 9(C)(i) but shall not be
     required to call a special meeting of stockholders in order to
     implement the provisions hereof.  In the event for any reason the
     Board of Directors is precluded from giving full effect to the Special
     Dividend provided in paragraph 9(C)(i), then no such Special Dividend
     shall be declared, but instead the Conversion Ratio shall
     automatically be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in
     effect immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata
     Repurchase by the Sec. 9(C) Non-Dilutive Share Fraction, and the
     Liquidation Preference and the Dividend Amount will not be adjusted.
     If subsequently the Board of Directors is able to give full effect to
     the Special Dividend as provided in paragraph 9(C)(i), then such
     Special Dividend will be declared in accordance with the provisions of
     paragraph 9(C)(i) and the adjustment in the Conversion Price as
     provided in this paragraph 9(C)(ii) will automatically be reversed and
     nullified prospectively.

               (D)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 9,
     the Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the
     Conversion Ratio unless such adjustment would require an increase or
     decrease equal to at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Ratio
     prior to such adjustment.  Any lesser adjustment shall be carried
     forward and shall be made no later than the time of, and together
     with, the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any
     adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an
     increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion
     Ratio.  All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the
     nearest one-hundredth of a cent or the nearest one-ten thousandth of a
     share, as the case may be.

               (E)  If the Corporation shall make any dividend or
     distribution of the Common Stock or issue any Common Stock, other
     capital stock or other equity security of the Corporation or any
     rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such security or any
     other transaction related to or having an impact upon its Common Stock
     or the Series C Preferred Stock, which transaction does not result in
     an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio pursuant to the foregoing
     provisions of this Section 9, the Board of Directors of the
     Corporation shall consider whether such action is of such a nature
     that it adversely affects the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock
     and that an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio, the provisions of
     Sections 5(B) or 6, or a subdivision or combination of the outstanding
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock into a greater or lesser number of
     such shares should equitably be made in respect of such transaction.
     If in such case the Board of Directors of the Corporation in its sole
     discretion determines that an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio, the
     provisions of Sections 5(B) or 6, or a subdivision or combination of
     the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock into a greater or<PAGE>
     lesser number of such shares should be made, such adjustment,
     subdivision or combination shall be made effective as of such date as
     determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  The
     determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation as to
     whether an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio, the provisions of
     Section 5(B) or 6, or a subdivision or combination of the outstanding
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock into a greater or lesser number of
     such shares should be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
     this Section 9(E), and, if so as to what adjustment, subdivision or
     combination should be made and when, shall be final and binding on the
     Corporation and all stockholders of the Corporation.  The Corporation
     shall be entitled to make such additional adjustment in the Conversion
     Ratio and the provisions of Section 5(B) or 6, in addition to those
     required by the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, as shall be
     necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in shares of
     capital stock of the Corporation, subdivision, reclassification or
     combination of shares of stock of the Corporation or any
     recapitalization of the Corporation shall not be taxable to holders of
     the Common Stock.

               (F)  For purposes of this resolution, the following
     definitions shall apply:

                    (i)   "Business Day" shall mean each day that is not a
     Saturday, Sunday or a date on which federally or state chartered
     banking institutions in Chicago, Illinois or New York, New York are
     required or authorized to be closed.

                    (ii)  "Extraordinary Distribution" shall mean any
     dividend or other distribution (effected while any of the shares of
     Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding) of (x) cash, where the
     aggregate amount of such cash dividend or distribution together with
     the amount of all cash dividends and distributions made during the
     preceding 12 months, when combined with the aggregate amount of all
     Pro Rata Repurchases (for this purpose, including only that portion of
     the aggregate purchase price of each such Pro Rata Repurchase which is
     in excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock repurchased as
     determined in accordance with paragraph 9(C)(i)), exceeds ten percent
     (10%) of the aggregate Fair Market Value of all shares of Common Stock
     outstanding on the record date for determining the shareholders
     entitled to receive such Extraordinary Distribution and/or (y) any
     shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than shares of
     Common Stock), other securities of the Corporation, evidences of
     indebtedness of the Corporation or any other person or any other
     property (including shares of any subsidiary of the Corporation), or
     any combination thereof.  The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary
     Distribution for purposes of Section 9(C) shall be equal to the sum of
     the Fair Market Value of such Extraordinary Distribution as of the
     date made.

                    (iii) "Fair Market Value" shall mean, as to shares of
     Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the
     Corporation or any other issuer which are publicly traded, the average
     of the "Current Market Prices" of such shares or such securities for
     each day of the Adjustment Period.  The "Fair Market Value" of any
     security which is not publicly traded or of any other property shall
     mean the fair value thereof as determined by an independent investment
     banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such
     securities or property selected in good faith by the Board of
     Directors of the Corporation or a committee thereof (which may be the<PAGE>
     independent appraiser engaged by any Plan) based on principles
     consistently applied, or, if no such investment banking or appraisal
     firm is in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or such
     committee available to make such determination, as determined in good
     faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or such committee.

                    (iv)  "Current Market Price" of publicly traded shares
     of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or other security
     of the Corporation or any other issuer for any day shall mean the last
     reported sales price, regular way, or, in case no such reported sale
     takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and
     asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the New York
     Stock Exchange Composite Tape, or, if such security is not listed or
     admitted to trading on such Exchange, on the principal national
     securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to
     trading, or if not listed or admitted to trading on any national
     securities exchange, on the National Association of Securities Dealers
     Automated Quotations National Market System, or, if such security is
     not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange
     or quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing
     bid and asked prices in the over-the-counter market as furnished by
     any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by
     the Board of Directors or a committee thereof for such purpose, in
     each case, on each trading day during the Adjustment Period.

                    (v)   "Adjustment Period" shall mean the period of five
     (5) consecutive trading days preceding, and including, the date as of
     which the Fair Market Value of a security is to be determined.

                    (vi)  "Sec. 9(F) Non-Dilutive Amount" in respect of an
     issuance, sale or exchange by the Corporation of any right or warrant
     to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock (including any security
     convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) shall
     mean (x) the product of (I) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common
     Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public
     announcement of such issuance, sale or exchange and (II) the maximum
     number of shares of Common Stock which could be acquired on such date
     upon the exercise in full of such rights and warrants (including upon
     the conversion or exchange of all such convertible or exchangeable
     securities), whether or not exercisable (or convertible or
     exchangeable) at such date, minus (y) the aggregate amount payable
     pursuant to such right or warrant to purchase or acquire such maximum
     number of shares of Common Stock; provided, however, that in no event
     shall the Sec. 9(F) Non-Dilutive Amount be less than zero.  For
     purposes of the foregoing sentence, in the case of a security
     convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, the
     amount payable pursuant to a right or warrant to purchase or acquire
     shares of Common Stock shall be the Fair Market Value of such security
     on the date of the issuance, sale or exchange of such security by the
     Corporation.

                    (vii) "Pro Rata Repurchase" shall mean any purchase of
     shares of Common Stock by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof,
     whether for cash, shares of capital stock of the Corporation, other
     securities of the Corporation, evidences of indebtedness of the
     Corporation or any other person or any other property (including
     shares of a subsidiary of the Corporation), or any combination
     thereof, effected while any of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock
     are outstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer
     subject to Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act, or any successor<PAGE>
     provision of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to
     substantially all holders of Common Stock; provided, however, that no
     purchase of shares by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof made
     in open market transactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata Repurchase.
     For purposes of this paragraph 9(F)(vii), shares shall be deemed to
     have been purchased by the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof "in
     open market transactions" if they have been purchased substantially in
     accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in effect under the
     Exchange Act, on the date shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
     initially issued by the Corporation or on such other terms and
     conditions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a committee
     thereof shall have determined are reasonably designed to prevent such
     purchases from having a material effect on the trading market for the
     Common Stock.

                    (viii) "Valuation Date" with respect to an Extraordi-
     nary Distribution shall mean the day immediately preceding (i) the ex-
     dividend date for such Extraordinary Distribution with respect to a
     security listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) the record
     date for such Extraordinary Distribution with respect to a security
     which is not listed on a national securities exchange.

               Section 10.  Retirement of Shares.  Any shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of the
     conversion or redemption of such shares as provided hereby, or
     otherwise so acquired, shall be cancelled as shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock and restored to the status of authorized but unissued
     shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, undesignated as to
     series, and may thereafter be reissued as part of a new series of
     Preferred Stock as permitted by law.

               Section 11.  Miscellaneous.

               (A)  All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and
     all notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon the
     earlier of receipt thereof or three (3) Business Days after the
     mailing thereof if sent by registered mail (unless first-class mail
     shall be specifically permitted for such notice under the terms of
     this Certificate of Designations) with postage prepaid, addressed: (i)
     if to the Corporation, to its office at McDonald's Plaza, Oak Brook,
     Illinois 60521 (Attention: Secretary) or to the transfer agent for the
     Series C Preferred Stock, or other agent of the Corporation designated
     as permitted by this Certificate or (ii) if to any holder of the
     Series C Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, to such
     holder at the address of such holder as listed in the stock record
     books of the Corporation (which may include the records of any
     transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as
     the case may be) or (iii) to such other address as the Corporation or
     any such holder, as the case may be, shall have designated by notice
     similarly given.

               (B)  In the event that, at any time as a result of an
     adjustment made pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the holder of any share
     of the Series C Preferred Stock upon surrendering such shares for
     conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares or other
     securities of the Corporation other than shares of Common Stock, the
     Conversion Ratio in respect of such other shares or securities so
     receivable upon conversion of shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
     thereafter be adjusted, and shall be subject to further adjustment
     from time to time, in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as<PAGE>
     practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained
     in Section 9 hereof, and the provisions of each of the other Sections
     hereof with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar
     terms to any such other shares or securities.

               (C)  The Corporation shall pay any and all stock transfer
     and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect of any
     issuance or delivery of shares of Series C Preferred Stock or shares
     of Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Series C
     Preferred Stock pursuant hereto or certificates representing such
     shares or securities.  The Corporation shall not, however, be required
     to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
     involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series C Preferred
     Stock or Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in
     which the shares of Series C Preferred Stock with respect to which
     such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were
     registered, or in respect of any payment to any person with respect to
     any such shares or securities other than a payment to the registered
     holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any such issuance,
     delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to
     such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Corporation the
     amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the
     Corporation, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

               (D)  In the event that a holder of shares of Series C
     Preferred Stock shall not by written notice designate the name in
     which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such
     shares should be registered or to whom payment upon redemption of
     shares of Series C Preferred Stock should be made or the address to
     which the certificate or certificates representing such shares, or
     such payment, should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to
     register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the holder
     of such Series C Preferred Stock as shown on the records of the
     Corporation and to send the certificate or certificates representing
     such shares, or such payment, to the address of such holder shown on
     the records of the Corporation.

               (E)  Unless otherwise provided in this Certificate of
     Designations, as the same may be amended, all payments in the form of
     dividends, distributions on voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
     liquidation or winding-up or otherwise made upon the shares of Series
     C Preferred Stock and any other stock ranking on a parity with the
     Series C Preferred Stock with respect to such dividend or distribution
     shall be made pro rata, so that amounts paid per share on the Series C
     Preferred Stock and such other stock shall in all cases bear to each
     other the same ratio that the required dividends, distributions or
     payments, as the case may be, then payable per share on the shares of
     the Series C Preferred Stock and such other stock bear to each other.

               (F)  The Corporation may appoint, and from time to time
     discharge and change, a transfer agent for the Series C Preferred
     Stock.  Upon any such appointment or discharge of a transfer agent,
     the Corporation shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage
     prepaid, to each holder of record of Series C Preferred Stock.

               4.   Series D Preferred Stock.

               FURTHER RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority granted to
     and vested in the Board of Directors of this Corporation (hereinafter
     called the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") in accordance with the<PAGE>
     provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of
     Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, without par
     value (the "Preferred Stock"), of the Corporation and hereby states
     the designation and number of shares, and fixes the relative rights,
     preferences and limitations thereof as follows:

                           Series D Preferred Stock:

               Section 1.  Designation and Amount.  The shares of such
     series shall be designated as Series D Preferred Stock (the "Series D
     Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting the Series D
     Preferred Stock shall be three hundred thousand (300,000). Shares of
     Series D Preferred Stock shall have a stated value of $100 per share.
     Such number may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board
     of Directors; provided, however that no decrease shall reduce the
     number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock to a number less than the
     number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved
     for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or
     warrants issued by or upon the conversion of any outstanding
     securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Series D
     Preferred Stock.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

               (A)  Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of
     any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and
     superior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,
     the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock, in preference to
     the holders of Common Stock and of any other Junior Stock (as
     hereinafter defined in Section 4(B)), shall be entitled to receive a
     cash dividend payable in an amount per share equal to $1.25 per
     quarter and no more (such amount being referred to herein as the
     "Dividend Amount"), which dividend shall be payable when and as
     declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for
     the purpose, payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of March,
     June, September and December in each year (each such date being
     referred to herein as "Dividend Payment Date"), subject to Section
     2(B) below, commencing on the first Dividend Payment Date after the
     first issuance of a share of Series D Preferred Stock.  In the event
     that any Dividend Payment Date shall occur on any day other than a
     "Business Day" (as hereinafter defined), the dividend payment due on
     such Dividend Payment Date shall be paid on the Business Day
     immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date.  The Board of
     Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of
     shares of Series D Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a
     dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be
     not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
     For purposes of these resolutions, "Business Day" shall mean each day
     that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a date on which federally or state
     chartered banking institutions in Chicago, Illinois or New York, New
     York are required or authorized to be closed.

               (B)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on
     outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock from the date of issue
     of such shares and shall accrue on a daily basis whether or not
     declared and whether or not the Corporation shall have earnings or
     surplus out of which such dividends could be paid at the time.
     Dividends accrued on the shares of Series D Preferred Stock for any
     period less than a full quarterly period between Dividend Payment
     Dates shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of 30-day<PAGE>
     months and in lieu of the initial quarterly dividend, such a
     proportional dividend shall accrue for the period from the date of
     issue until the first Dividend Payment Date after the issuance of any
     such shares.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.
     Accumulated but unpaid dividends shall cumulate as of the Dividend
     Payment Date on which they first become payable, but no interest shall
     accrue on accumulated but unpaid dividends.

               (C)  Dividends paid on the shares of Series D Preferred
     Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the
     time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on
     a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series
     D Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (A)  Each share of Series D Preferred Stock shall entitle
     the holder thereof to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of
     the stockholders of the Corporation.

               (B)  Except as otherwise provided by law or in the Restated
     Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Series D
     Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any
     other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights
     shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of
     stockholders of the Corporation.

               (C)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by
     law or in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, holders of
     Series D Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their
     consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled
     to vote with holders of Common stock as set forth herein) for taking
     any corporate action.  Any increase or decrease in the authorized
     class of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to alter or change the
     powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of Series D
     Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely within the meaning of
     the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and no class vote
     shall be required to authorize such increase or decrease.

               Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

               (A)  So long as any Series D Preferred Stock shall be
     outstanding, no dividend shall be declared and paid or set apart for
     payment on any other series of stock ranking on a parity with the
     Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends ("Parity Stock"), unless
     there shall also be or have been declared and paid or set apart for
     payment on the Series D Preferred Stock dividends for all dividend
     payment periods of the Series D Preferred Stock ending on or before
     the dividend payment date of such Parity Stock, ratably in proportion
     to the respective amounts of dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock
     accumulated and unpaid through the most recent such dividend payment
     period, and accumulated and unpaid on such Parity Stock through the
     dividend payment period on such Parity Stock ending on such dividend
     payment date or such dividend payment date immediately preceding such
     dividend payment period.

               (B)  So long as any Series D Preferred Stock shall be
     outstanding, in the event that full cumulative dividends on the Series
     D Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid or set apart for
     payment, the Corporation shall not declare and pay or set apart for<PAGE>
     payment any dividends or make any other distributions on, or make any
     payment on account of the purchase, redemption or other retirement of,
     Common Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof of the
     Corporation ranking, as to dividends or as to distributions in the
     event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
     junior to the Series D Preferred Stock (collectively, "Junior Stock")
     until full cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred
     Stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment;
     provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) any
     dividend payable solely in any shares of Junior Stock, or (ii) the
     acquisition of shares of Junior Stock either (x) pursuant to any
     employee or director incentive or benefit plan or arrangement of the
     Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation heretofore or
     hereafter adopted or (y) in exchange solely for shares of any other
     Junior Stock.  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4,
     the Board of Directors may declare and the Corporation may pay or set
     apart for payment dividends and other distributions on any Junior
     Stock or Parity Stock; and may purchase or otherwise redeem or retire
     any of the Junior Stock or Parity Stock or any warrants, rights, or
     options or other securities exercisable for or convertible into any of
     the Junior Stock or Parity Stock and the holders of shares of the
     Series D Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.

               Section 5.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.

               (A)  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of
     shares of Junior Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of
     Series D Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share (such
     amount being referred to herein as the "Liquidation Preference"), plus
     an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions
     thereon, whether or not declared, as to the date of such payment, or
     (ii) to the holders of shares of Parity Stock, except distributions
     made ratably on the Series D Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock
     in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such
     shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
     After payment of the full amount to which they are entitled as
     provided by the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(A), the holders
     of shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any
     further right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the
     Corporation.

               (B)  Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation
     with or into any other corporation or other entity, nor the merger or
     consolidation of any other corporation or other entity with or into
     the Corporation, nor the sale, transfer or lease of all or any portion
     of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of this
     Section 5.

               (C)  Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating the
     payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts
     distributable to holders of Series D Preferred Stock in such
     circumstances shall be payable, shall be made in accordance with
     Section 8 below not less than 20 days prior to any payment date stated
     therein, to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock, at their
     respective addresses shown on the books of the Corporation or any
     transfer agent for the Series D Preferred Stock; provided, however,
     that a failure to give notice as provided herein or any defect therein<PAGE>
     shall not affect the Corporation's ability to consummate a voluntary
     or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation.

               Section 6.  Redemption.

               All of the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock shall be
     redeemed, by the Corporation, out of funds legally available therefor,
     on the later of (i) February 1, 1997 and (ii) the death of Maurice J.
     Sullivan, an individual residing in the State of Hawaii, to whom the
     initial shares of Series D Preferred Stock will initially be issued
     (the "Redemption Date").  The shares shall be redeemed at a price of
     $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends
     thereon, to the Redemption Date (the "Redemption Price").  On or
     subsequent to the Redemption Date, upon surrender of the certificates
     for any shares to be redeemed pursuant to the provisions of this
     Section 6, the Redemption Price of such shares shall be paid in cash.
     In the event that the Redemption Price is either paid or made
     available for payment, then, notwithstanding that the certificate or
     certificates evidencing any of the shares of the Series D Preferred
     Stock shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to such
     shares shall terminate, effective on the Redemption Date, and any such
     certificate shall represent only the right to receive the Redemption
     Price, without interest, upon surrender.  No interest shall accrue on
     the Redemption Price after the Redemption Date.

               Section 7.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series D
     Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of the
     redemption of such shares as provided hereby, or otherwise so
     acquired, shall be retired and the Corporation shall take all actions
     necessary to restore such shares to the status of authorized but
     unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the
     Corporation, which shares may thereafter be reissued as part of a new
     series of such Preferred Stock or as Series D Preferred Stock, as
     permitted by law.

               Section 8.  Miscellaneous.

               (A)  All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and
     delivered personally, sent by courier, or by registered or certified
     mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) addressed:  (i) if to
     the Corporation, to its office at McDonald's Plaza, Oak Brook,
     Illinois 60521 (Attention: Secretary) or to the transfer agent
     designated by the Corporation or (ii) if to any holder of the Series D
     Preferred Stock, to such holder at the address of such holder as
     listed in the stock records books of the Corporation (which may
     include the records of any transfer agent for the Series D Preferred
     Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be) or (iii) to such other
     address as the Corporation or any such holder, as the case may be,
     shall have designated by notice similarly given.

               (B)  The Corporation shall pay any and all stock transfer
     and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect of any
     issuance or delivery or shares of Series D Preferred Stock or
     certificates representing such shares.  The Corporation shall not,
     however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in
     respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares
     of Series D Preferred Stock in a name other than the name in which the
     shares of Series D Preferred Stock with respect to which such shares
     are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment<PAGE>
     to any person with respect to any such shares other than a payment to
     the registered holder thereof, and shall not be required to make any
     such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person
     otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to
     the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the
     satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid or is not
     payable.

               (C)  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
     Designations as the same may be amended, all payments in the form of
     dividends, distributions on voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
     liquidation or winding-up otherwise made upon the shares of Series D
     Preferred Stock and any other stock ranking on a parity with the
     Series D Preferred Stock with respect to such dividend or distribution
     shall be made pro rata, so that amounts paid per share on the Series D
     Preferred Stock and such other stock shall in all cases bear to each
     other the same ratio that the required dividends, distributions or
     payments, as the case may be, then payable per share on the shares of
     the Series D Preferred Stock and such other stock bear to each other.

               (D)  The Corporation may appoint and from time to time
     discharge and change, a transfer agent for the Series D Preferred
     Stock.  Upon any such appointment or discharge of a transfer agent,
     the Corporation shall send notice thereof in accordance with Section
     8(A) to each holder of record of Series D Preferred Stock.

               5.   Series E Preferred Stock.

               RESOLVED, That the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock,
     without par value, of the Corporation is hereby authorized and the
     designations, preferences and privileges, relative, participating,
     optional and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and
     restrictions thereof, in addition to those set forth in the Restated
     Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, are hereby fixed as
     follows:

                   7.72% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E

               Section 1.  Designation and Amount.  The shares of such
     series shall be designated as 7.72% Cumulative Preferred Stock,
     Series E (the "Series E Preferred Stock"), and the number of shares
     constituting the Series E Preferred Stock shall be 10,000.  Shares of
     Series E Preferred Stock shall have a liquidation preference of
     $50,000 per share.  The number of shares may be increased or
     decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however,
     that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series E
     Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then
     outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the
     exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants issued by or upon
     the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the
     Corporation convertible into Series E Preferred Stock.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

               (A)  Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of
     any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior
     and superior to Series E Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,
     the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, in preference to
     the holders of Common Stock and of any other Junior Stock (as
     hereinafter defined in Section 4(B)), shall be entitled to receive a<PAGE>
     cash dividend payable in an amount per share equal to $965.00 per
     quarter and no more (such amount being referred to herein as the
     "Dividend Amount"), which dividend shall be payable when, as and if
     declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available
     for that purpose,  quarterly in arrears on the first day of March,
     June, September and December in each year (each such date being
     referred to herein as a "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on March
     1, 1993.  In the event that any Dividend Payment Date shall occur on
     any day other than a "Business Day" (as hereinafter defined), the
     dividend payment due on such Dividend Payment Date shall be paid on
     the Business Day immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date.
     The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of
     holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock entitled to receive
     payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record
     date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the
     payment thereof.  For purposes of these resolutions, "Business Day"
     shall mean each day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a date on which
     federally or state chartered banking institutions in Chicago,
     Illinois or New York, New York are required or authorized to be
     closed.

               (B)  Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares
     of Series E Preferred Stock from the date of original issuance of
     such shares and shall accrue on a daily basis whether or not declared
     and whether or not the Corporation shall have earnings or surplus out
     of which such dividends could be paid at the time.  Dividends accrued
     on the shares of Series E Preferred Stock for any period greater or
     less than a full quarterly period between Dividend Payment Dates
     shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
     months.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.
     Accrued but unpaid dividends shall cumulate as of the Dividend
     Payment Date on which they first become payable, but no interest
     shall accrue on such accumulated but unpaid dividends.

               (C)  Dividends paid on the shares of Series E Preferred
     Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at
     the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro
     rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time
     outstanding.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.

               (A)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by
     law or in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Series
     E Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their
     consent shall not be required for taking any corporate action. On
     those matters where voting rights are conferred herein, by law or in
     the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each share of Series E
     Preferred Stock shall entitle the voter thereof to one vote.  Any
     increase or decrease in the authorized class of Preferred Stock shall
     not be deemed to alter or change the powers, preferences, or special
     rights of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock so as to affect them
     adversely within the meaning of the General Corporation Law of the
     State of Delaware and no class vote shall be required to authorize
     such increase or decrease.

               (B)  If at any time dividends payable on Series E Preferred
     Stock, or on any one or more other series of Preferred Stock of the
     Corporation entitled to receive cumulative preferred dividends, are
     in arrears and unpaid in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount<PAGE>
     of dividends payable on such Series E Preferred Stock and/or other
     series of Preferred Stock entitled to receive cumulative dividends
     for six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the
     holders of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock entitled to
     receive cumulative preferred dividends will have the exclusive right,
     voting separately as a class, to elect two directors to the Board of
     Directors of the Corporation at the next annual meeting of
     stockholders of the Corporation.  The authorized number of Directors
     shall not be increased for this purpose.  Such voting right will
     continue for such Preferred Stock until all dividends on Series E
     Preferred Stock and on such other series have been paid in full, at
     which time such voting right of the holders of such Preferred Stock
     will terminate, subject to re-vesting in the event of a subsequent
     arrearage.  Upon any termination of the aforesaid voting right, the
     term of office of those directors elected by holders of Preferred
     Stock voting separately as a class will terminate.

               Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

               (A)  So long as any Series E Preferred Stock shall be
     outstanding, no dividend shall be declared and paid or set apart for
     payment on any other series of stock ranking on a parity with Series
     E Preferred Stock as to dividends ("Parity Stock"), unless there
     shall also be or have been declared and paid or set apart for payment
     on Series E Preferred Stock dividends for all dividend payment
     periods of Series E Preferred Stock ending on or before the dividend
     payment date of such Parity Stock, ratably in proportion to the
     respective amounts of dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock
     accrued and unpaid through the most recent such dividend payment
     period, and accrued and unpaid on such Parity Stock through the
     dividend payment period on such Parity Stock ending on such dividend
     payment date or such dividend payment date immediately preceding such
     dividend payment period.

               (B)  So long as any Series E Preferred Stock shall be
     outstanding, in the event that full cumulative dividends on the
     Series E Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid or set apart
     for payment when due, the Corporation shall not declare and pay or
     set apart for payment any dividends on Common Stock or any other
     class of stock or series thereof of the Corporation ranking as to
     dividends junior to Series E Preferred Stock (collectively, "Junior
     Stock") until full cumulative and unpaid dividends on Series E
     Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart for
     payment; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any
     dividend payable solely in any shares of Junior Stock.  Subject to
     the foregoing provisions of this Section 4, the Board of Directors
     may declare and the Corporation may pay or set apart for payment
     dividends on any Junior Stock or Parity Stock and the holders of
     shares of  Series E Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share
     therein.

               Section 5.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.

               (A)  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, no distribution shall
     be made (i) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior to the
     Series E Preferred Stock as to distributions in the event of any
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation unless,
     prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
     shall have received $50,000 per share (such amount being referred to<PAGE>
     herein as the "Liquidation Preference"), plus an amount equal to
     accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or
     not declared, as to the date of such payment, or (ii) to the holders
     of shares of  stock ranking on a parity with the Series E Preferred
     Stock as to distributions in the event of any liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up of the Corporation ("Parity Liquidation
     Stock"), except distributions made ratably on Series E Preferred
     Stock and all such Parity Liquidation Stock in proportion to the
     total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled
     upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  After payment of
     the full amount to which they are entitled as provided by the
     foregoing provisions of this Section 5(A), the holders of shares of
     Series E Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any further right
     or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.

               (B)  Neither the merger or consolidation of the Corporation
     with or into any other corporation or other entity, nor the merger or
     consolidation of any other corporation or other entity with or into
     the Corporation, nor the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of
     all or any portion of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed
     to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for
     purposes of this Section 5.

               (C)  Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating
     the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the
     amounts distributable to holders of Series E Preferred Stock in such
     circumstances shall be payable, shall be made in accordance with
     Section 9 below not less than 20 days prior to any payment date
     stated therein, to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, at their
     respective addresses shown on the books of the Corporation or any
     transfer agent for the Series E Preferred Stock; provided, however,
     that a failure to give notice as provided herein or any defect
     therein shall not affect the Corporation's ability to consummate a
     voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
     the Corporation.

               Section 6.  Redemption.  The Series E Preferred Stock will
     not be redeemable prior to December 3, 1997.  The Series E Preferred
     Stock will be redeemable, at the option of the Corporation, in whole
     or in part, out of funds legally available therefor, at any time, on
     or after December 3, 1997, upon not less than 30 nor more than 90
     days' notice, at a redemption price per share of Series E Preferred
     Stock equal to the Liquidation Preference, plus an amount equal to
     accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.  On or
     subsequent to the redemption date, upon surrender of the certificates
     for any shares to be redeemed pursuant to the provisions of this
     Section 6, the redemption price of such shares shall be paid in cash.
     In the event that the redemption price is either paid or made
     available for payment, then, notwithstanding that the certificate or
     certificates evidencing any of the shares of the Series E Preferred
     Stock shall not have been surrendered, all rights with respect to
     such shares shall terminate, effective on the redemption date, and
     any such certificate shall represent only the right to receive the
     redemption price, without interest, upon surrender.  No interest
     shall accrue on the redemption price after the redemption date.

               Section 7.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series E
     Preferred Stock acquired by the Corporation by reason of the
     redemption of such shares as provided hereby, or otherwise acquired,<PAGE>
     shall be retired and the Corporation shall take all actions necessary
     to restore such shares to the status of authorized but unissued
     shares of Preferred Stock, without par value, of the Corporation,
     which shares may thereafter be reissued as part of a new series of
     such Preferred Stock or as Series E Preferred Stock, as permitted by
     law.

               Section 8.  Ranking.  The Series E Preferred Stock will
     rank on a parity as to payment of dividends and distribution of
     assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether voluntary
     or involuntary, of the Corporation with the Corporation's Series B
     ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred
     Stock and Series D Preferred Stock (which are the only series of
     Preferred Stock currently outstanding) and prior to the Corporation's
     Common Stock.  The Series E Preferred Stock will rank prior to the
     Corporation's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
     "Series A Preferred Stock") as to the payment of dividends and on a
     parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to distribution of assets
     upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether voluntary or
     involuntary, if such Series A Preferred Stock is issued.

               Section 9.  Miscellaneous.

               (A)  All notices referred to herein shall be in writing,
     and delivered personally, sent by courier, or by registered or
     certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) addressed:
     (i) if to the Corporation, to its office at One McDonald's Plaza, Oak
     Brook, Illinois 60521 (Attention: Secretary) or to the transfer agent
     designated by the Corporation or (ii) if to any holder of Series E
     Preferred Stock, to such holder at the address of such holder as
     listed in the stock record books of the Corporation or (iii) to such
     other address as the Corporation or any such holder, as the case may
     be, shall have designated by notice similarly given.

               (B)  The Corporation shall pay any and all stock transfer
     and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in respect of any
     issuance or delivery of shares of Series E Preferred Stock or
     certificates representing such shares.  The Corporation shall not,
     however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in
     respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of
     shares of Series E Preferred Stock in a name other than the name in
     which such shares of Series E Preferred Stock were registered, or in
     respect of any payment to any person with respect to any such shares
     other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and shall not
     be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and
     until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or
     payment has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has
     established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
     has been paid or is not payable.

               (C)  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
     Designations, Preferences and Rights, as the same may be amended, all
     payments in the form of dividends, distributions on voluntary or
     involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up otherwise made
     upon the shares of Series E Preferred Stock and any other stock
     ranking on a parity with Series E Preferred Stock with respect to
     such dividend or distribution shall be made pro rata, so that amounts
     paid per share on Series E Preferred Stock and such other stock shall
     in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that the required
     dividends, distributions or payments, as the case may be, then<PAGE>
     payable per share on the shares of the Series E Preferred Stock and
     such other stock bear to each other.

               (D)  The Corporation may appoint, and from time to time
     discharge and change, a transfer agent for Series E Preferred Stock.
     Upon any such appointment or discharge of a transfer agent, the
     Corporation shall send notice thereof in accordance with Section 9(A)
     to each holder of record of Series E Preferred Stock.

               FIFTH:  The minimum amount of capital with which the
     Corporation will commence business is One Thousand Dollars ($1,000).

               SIXTH:  The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

               SEVENTH:  The private property of the stockholders of the
     Corporation shall not be subject to the payment of corporate debts to
     any extent whatsoever.

               EIGHTH:  In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
     conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware the Board of Directors
     is expressly authorized and empowered:

               (a)  In the manner provided in the by-laws of the
     Corporation to make, alter, amend and repeal the by-laws of the
     Corporation in any respect not inconsistent with the laws of the State
     of Delaware or with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
     Corporation;

               (b)  By a resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of
     the whole Board, to designate one or more committees, each committee
     to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation which,
     to the extent provided in said resolution or resolutions or in the by-
     laws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise the powers of the
     Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of
     the Corporation, and may have power to authorize the seal of the
     Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.  Such
     committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be stated
     in the by-laws of the Corporation or as may be determined from time to
     time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors;

               (c)  Subject to any applicable provisions of the by-laws of
     the Corporation then in effect, to determine from time to time,
     whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what
     conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the Corporation,
     or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of the stockholders;
     and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect any account or book
     or document of the Corporation, except as conferred by the laws of the
     State of Delaware, unless and until authorized so to do by resolution
     of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders of the Corporation;

               (d)  To fix from time to time the amount of the surplus or
     profits of the Corporation to be reserved as working capital or for
     any other lawful purpose;

               (e)  Without any action by the stockholders, to authorize
     the borrowing of moneys for any of the purposes of the Corporation
     and, from time to time without limit as to amount, to authorize and
     cause the making, execution, issuance, sale or other disposition of
     promissory notes, drafts, bonds, debentures and other negotiable or<PAGE>
     non-negotiable instruments and evidences of indebtedness, and the
     securing of the same by mortgage, pledge, deed of trust or otherwise.

               In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by
     statute expressly conferred upon it, the Board of Directors may
     exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be
     exercised, or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
     provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware, this Restated
     Certificate of Incorporation and the by-laws of the Corporation.

               Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of
     the directors or of any committee, which shall be ratified by the
     holders of a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation
     present in person or by proxy and voting at any annual meeting, or at
     any special meeting called for such purpose, shall, insofar as
     permitted by law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, be
     as valid and as binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the
     Corporation.

               The Corporation may enter into contracts or transact
     business with one or more of its directors, or with any firm of which
     one or more of its directors are members or with any trust, firm,
     corporation or association in which any one or more of its directors
     is a stockholder, director or officer or otherwise interested, and any
     such contract or transaction shall not be invalidated in the absence
     of fraud because such director or directors have or may have interests
     therein which are or might be adverse to the interest of the
     Corporation, even though the presence and/or vote of the director or
     directors having such adverse interest shall have been necessary to
     constitute a quorum and/or to obligate the Corporation upon such
     contract or transaction, provided that such interests shall have been
     disclosed to the other directors and a majority of the directors
     voting shall have approved such contract or transaction; and no
     director having such adverse interest shall be liable to this
     Corporation or to any stockholder or creditor thereof, or to any other
     person for any loss incurred by it under or by reason of any such
     contract or transaction; nor shall any such director or directors be
     accountable for any gains or profits realized thereon.

               The Corporation shall have power to indemnify any and all of
     its directors or officers or former directors or officers or any
     person who may have served at its request as a director or officer of
     another corporation in which it owns shares of capital stock or of
     which it is a creditor against liabilities and expenses actually and
     necessarily incurred by them in connection with the defense of any
     action, suit or proceeding in which they, or any of them, are made
     parties, or a party, by reason of being or having been directors or
     officers or a director or officer of the Corporation, or of such other
     corporation, except in relation to matters as to which any such
     director or officer or former director or officer or person shall be
     adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding to be liable for
     negligence or misconduct in the performance of duty. Such
     indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
     which those indemnified may be entitled, under any by-law, agreement,
     vote of stockholders or otherwise.

               NINTH:  Meetings of stockholders may be held outside the
     State of Delaware, if the by-laws so provide.  The books of the
     Corporation may be kept (subject to the laws of the State of Delaware)
     outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be<PAGE>
     designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the by-
     laws of the Corporation.  Elections of directors need not be by ballot
     unless the by-laws of the Corporation shall so provide.

               TENTH:  The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter,
     change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate
     of Incorporation, to the extent and in the manner now or hereafter
     prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders
     herein are granted subject to this reservation.

               ELEVENTH:  It is hereby declared to be a proper corporate
     purpose, reasonably calculated to benefit stockholders, for the Board
     of Directors to base the response of the Corporation to any
     'Acquisition Proposal' on the Board of Directors' evaluation of what
     is in the best interests of the Corporation and for the Board of
     Directors, in evaluating what is in the best interests of the
     Corporation, to consider:

               (i)   the best interest of the stockholders; for this
     purpose the Board shall consider, among other factors, not only the
     consideration being offered in the Acquisition Proposal, in relation
     to the then current market price, but also in relation to the then
     current value of the Corporation in a freely negotiated transaction
     and in relation to the Board of Directors' then estimate of the future
     value of the Corporation as an independent entity; and

               (ii)  such other factors as the Board of Directors deter-
     mines to be relevant, including, among other factors, the social,
     legal and economic effects upon franchisees, employees, suppliers,
     customers and business.

               "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal of any person (a)
     for a tender offer or exchange offer for any equity security of the
     Corporation, (b) to merge or consolidate the Corporation with another
     corporation, or (c) to purchase or otherwise acquire all or
     substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation.

               TWELFTH:  Subject to all other applicable provisions of this
     Restated Certificate of Incorporation and to all applicable provisions
     of the law of Delaware, relating, inter alia, to stockholder approval,
     the Board of Directors shall have the power to merge or consolidate
     the Corporation with another corporation or to sell, lease or exchange
     all or substantially all of the property and assets of the
     Corporation, including its good will and its corporate franchises,
     upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration, which may
     be in whole or in part shares of stock in, and/or other securities of,
     any corporation or corporations, as the Board of Directors shall deem
     expedient and for the best interests of the Corporation, but,
     regardless of any other provision of this Restated Certificate of
     Incorporation, if any party to any such transaction shall be a person
     or entity owning, immediately prior to the consummation of such
     transaction, of record or beneficially, 2% or more of the stock of the
     Corporation issued and outstanding having voting power, such power of
     the Board of Directors shall be exercisable only when and as duly
     authorized by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66-
     2/3% of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding having
     voting power given at a stockholders' meeting duly called for that
     purpose; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the
     power to merge the Corporation with another corporation without action
     by the stockholders to the extent and in the manner permitted from<PAGE>
     time to time by the law of Delaware.  In determining whether or not
     any person or entity (the 'Primary Holder') owns, of record or
     beneficially, 2% or more of the stock of the Corporation issued and
     outstanding having voting power, there shall be aggregated with all
     shares of such stock owned of record or beneficially by the Primary
     Holder (a) all shares of such stock owned of record or beneficially by
     any person or entity who or which would be deemed to be controlling,
     controlled by or under common control with the Primary Holder under
     the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of
     1934, as amended, any federal statute enacted to take the place of
     either or both such statutes or any regulation promulgated under
     either of such statutes or such successor statutes (an 'Affiliate')
     and (b) all shares of such stock owned of record or beneficially by
     any person or entity acting in concert with the Primary Holder and/or
     with an Affiliate of the Primary Holder.  This Article Twelfth shall
     not be altered, amended or repealed except by the affirmative vote of
     the holders of not less than 66-2/3% of the stock of the Corporation
     issued and outstanding having voting power, given at a stockholders'
     meeting duly called for that purpose, upon a proposal adopted by the
     Board of Directors.

               THIRTEENTH:  Board of Directors.

               (a)  Number, Election and Terms.  The business and affairs
     of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a
     Board of Directors consisting of not less than 11 nor more than 24
     persons.  The exact number of directors within the minimum and maximum
     limitations specified in the preceding sentence shall be fixed from
     time to time by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution
     adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.

               At the 1983 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the directors
     shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as
     possible, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the
     1984 annual meeting of stockholders, the term of office of the second
     class to expire at the 1985 annual meeting of stockholders and the
     term of office of the third class to expire at the 1986 annual meeting
     of stockholders.

               At each annual meeting of stockholders following such
     initial classification and election, directors elected to succeed
     those whose terms then expire shall be elected for a term of office
     expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after
     their election.

               (b)  Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies.  Subject to
     the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then
     outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase
     in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of
     Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement,
     disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall be filled
     by a majority vote of the directors then in office. Directors so
     chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of
     stockholders at which the term of the class to which they have been
     elected expires.  No decrease in the number of directors constituting
     the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
     director.

               (c)  Removal.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any
     series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any director, or the<PAGE>
     entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, but
     only for cause and only by the affirmative votes of the holders of at
     least 80% of the voting power of all the shares of the Corporation
     entitled to vote for the election of directors.

               (d)  Amendment, Repeal, Etc.  Notwithstanding anything to
     the contrary contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
     the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting
     power of all of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote for the
     election of directors shall be required to amend, alter or repeal, or
     to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article Thirteenth.

               FOURTEENTH:  Stockholder Action.  Any action required or
     permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be
     effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of
     the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by
     such stockholders.  Special meetings of stockholders of the
     Corporation may be called upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days'
     written notice only by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution
     approved by a majority of the Board of Directors.  Notwithstanding
     anything contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to
     the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of
     the voting power of all of the shares of the Corporation entitled to
     vote for the election of directors shall be required to amend, alter
     or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article
     Fourteenth.

               FIFTEENTH:  Elimination of Certain Liability of Directors.
     To the fullest extent that the general corporate law of the State of
     Delaware, as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be
     amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of
     directors, no director of the Corporation shall be liable to the
     Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
     fiduciary duty as a director.  No amendment to or repeal of this
     Article Fifteenth shall apply to or have any effect on liability or
     alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with
     respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to
     such amendment or repeal.

               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Restated Certificate of
     Incorporation, which restates and integrates but does not further
     amend the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
     McDonald's Corporation, as heretofore amended or supplemented, there
     being no discrepancy between such Restated Certificate of
     Incorporation, as so amended and supplemented, and the provisions
     hereof, and having been adopted in accordance with Section 245 of the
     Delaware General Corporation Law, has been executed by its Senior Vice
     President and attested by its Assistant Secretary, as of this 15th day
     of November, 1994.

     the business of the Corporation may require.

                     ARTICLE II - MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Section l - Place of Meetings - The Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
     any other meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place as may
     from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors and set
     forth in a notice thereof.

     Section 2 - Annual Election of Directors - The Annual Meeting of
     Stockholders for the election of Directors and the transaction of
     other business shall be held each year on the date determined by the
     Board of Directors.  If this date shall fall upon a legal holiday, the
     meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day.  At each
     annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote shall elect
     Directors to succeed those whose terms then expire and may transact
     any other proper business.  Any previously scheduled meeting of the

     of any series of Preferred Stock in a resolution of the Board of
     Directors adopted pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation), in
     person or by proxy, for each share of stock entitled to vote held by
     such stockholder but no proxy shall be voted after three (3) years
     from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period.  Any
     motion brought before a stockholder meeting must be seconded before a
     vote will be taken.  All votes by stockholders on proposed amendments
     to the Certificate of Incorporation and all elections of Directors,
     shall be by written ballot.  All elections for Directors shall be
     decided by a plurality of the votes of the shares present at the
     meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the election
     of directors; all other questions shall be decided by majority vote of
     the shares entitled to vote on the subject matter and present, in
     person or by proxy, at the meeting, except as otherwise provided by

     Whether or not there is such a quorum present at any meeting, the
     chairman of the meeting or a majority of the shares so present or
     represented, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to
     time.  No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be
     given except as required by law.  At any such adjourned meeting at
     which the requisite amount of stock entitled to vote shall be repre-
     sented, any business may be transacted which might have been
     transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.  If the adjournment
     is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new
     record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the
     adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record
     entitled to vote at the meeting.

     Section 5 - Special Meetings - Special meetings of the stockholders
     for any purpose or purposes may be called only by the Board of
     Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the Board
     of Directors and shall be called by the Secretary in accordance with
     any such resolution.

     Section 6 - Notice of Meetings - Written or printed notice stating the
     place, date, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for
     which the meeting is called, shall be given by the Secretary to each
     stockholder entitled to vote thereat at his address as it appears on
     the records of the Corporation not less than ten (l0) nor more than
     sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting.  Business transacted

     the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by
     such stockholders.

     Section 8 - Nomination and Stockholder Business -

          (A)  Annual Meetings of Stockholders - (1)  Nominations of
     persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and
     the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders at an
     annual meeting of stockholders may be made (a) pursuant to the
     Corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the
     Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who
     was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided
     for in this Section 8, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who
     complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 8.

               (2)  For nominations or other business to be properly
     brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause
     (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 8, such business, as
     determined by the Chairman of the meeting, must be a proper subject
     for stockholder consideration under Delaware corporate law, and the
     stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the
     Secretary of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice
     shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices
     of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety
     (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's
     annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of
     the annual meeting is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or
     delayed by more than sixty (60) days from such anniversary date,
     notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not
     earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and
     not later than the close of business on the later of the sixtieth
     (60th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day
     following the date on which public announcement of the date of such
     meeting is first made.  Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a)
     as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
     election or reelection as a director all information relating to such
     person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies
     for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case
     pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
     as amended (the "Exchange Act") (Including such person's written
     consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to
     serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that
     the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief
     description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting,
     the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any
     material interest in such business of such stockholder and the
     beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
     (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner,
     if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the
     name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corpora-
     tion's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and
     number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and
     of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.

               (3)  Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of
     paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 8 to the contrary, in the event that
     the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the
     Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement naming
     all of the nominees for Directors or specifying the size of the
     increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least seventy
     (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's
     annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 8
     shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for
     any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered
     to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation
     not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following
     the day on which such public announcement is first made by the
     Corporation.

          (B)  Special Meetings of Stockholders - Only such business shall
     be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
     brought before the meeting of stockholders pursuant to the
     Corporation's notice of meeting.  Nominations of persons for election
     to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of
     stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
     Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the
     Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is
     a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for
     in this Section 8, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and
     who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 8.
     Nominations by stockholders of such persons for election to the Board
     of Directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders if
     the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section
     8 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
     offices of the Corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day
     prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business
     on the later of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting
     or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement
     is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees
     proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

          (C)  General - (1)  Only such persons who are nominated in
     accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8 shall be
     eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be
     conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought
     before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
     Section 8.  The Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty
     to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be
     brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures
     set forth in this Section 8 and, if any proposed nomination or
     business is not in compliance with this Section 8, to declare that
     such defective proposal shall be disregarded.

               (2)  For purposes of this Section 8, "public announcement"
     shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones
     News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or
     in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities
     and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the
     Exchange Act.

               (3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
     Section 8, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable
     requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
     thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 8.
     Nothing in this Section 8 shall be deemed to affect any rights of
     stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's
     proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

                            ARTICLE III - DIRECTORS

     Section l - Number and Term - The number of Directors who shall
     constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be the number fixed from
     time to time by the Board of Directors in accordance with the
     Certificate of Incorporation and shall in no event be less than eleven
     (11) nor more than twenty-four (24).  At the 1983 Annual Meeting of
     Stockholders, the Directors were divided into three (3) classes, as
     nearly equal in number as possible with the term of office of the
     first class to expire at the 1984 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the
     term of office of the second class to expire at the 1985 Annual
     Meeting of Stockholders, and the term of office of the third class to
     expire at the 1986 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  At each Annual
     Meeting of Stockholders following such initial classification and
     election, Directors elected to succeed those whose terms then expire
     shall be elected for a term of office expiring at the third succeeding
     Annual Meeting of Stockholders after their election and until their
     successors shall be elected and shall qualify.

     Section 2 - Resignations - Any Director or member of a committee of
     the Board of Directors may resign at any time.  Such resignation shall
     be made in writing and shall take effect at the time specified therein
     and if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by the
     President or Secretary.  The acceptance of a resignation shall not be
     necessary to make it effective.

     Section 3 - Newly-Created Directorships and Vacancies - Subject to the
     rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then
     outstanding, newly-created directorships resulting from any increase
     in the authorized number of Directors or any vacancies in the Board of
     Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement,
     disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall be filled
     by a majority vote of the Directors then in office, though less than a
     quorum.  Directors so chosen shall hold office for a term expiring at
     the Annual Meeting of Stockholders at which the term of the class to
     which they have been elected expires and until their successors shall
     be elected and shall qualify.  No decrease in the number of Directors
     constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any
     incumbent Director.

     Section 4 - Removal - Subject to the rights of the holders of any
     series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any Director, or the
     entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time but
     only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of
     eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all of the shares of the
     Corporation entitled to vote for the election of Directors.

     Section 5 - Powers - The Board of Directors shall exercise all of the
     powers of the Corporation, except such as are by law or by the
     Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or by these By-Laws
     conferred upon or reserved to the stockholders.

     Section 6 - Committees -

          (A)  Executive Committee - There shall be an Executive Committee
     of the Board of Directors selected from time to time by the Board of
     Directors from among its own membership.  Except as hereinafter
     provided, the Executive Committee shall have and may exercise all the
     powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of
     the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the
     seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require
     it.  The Executive Committee is expressly granted the power and
     authority to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to
     Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), and to
     declare dividends, provided that with respect to common stock
     dividends declared for any quarter, the rate per share does not exceed
     the rate per share paid in the previous quarter.

          (B)  Other Committees of the Board - The Board of Directors may,
     by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board,
     designate one or more other committees, each committee to consist of
     two or more of the Directors of the Corporation which, to the extent
     provided in said resolution or resolutions or in these By-Laws shall

     capacity as an officer, agent, or otherwise and receiving compensation
     therefor.

     the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, any action required
     or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or

     may be, consent thereto in writing and such written consent is filed

                   ARTICLE V - INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     Section 1 - Right to Indemnification -

          (A)  Indemnified Persons - Each person who was or is made a party
     or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or called as
     a witness in any Proceeding because he or she is an Indemnified
     Person, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
     the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation
     Law (the "DGCL"), as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended
     (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
     amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
     rights than the DGCL permitted the Corporation to provide prior to
     such amendment).  Such indemnification shall cover all expenses
     incurred by an Indemnified Person (including, but not limited to,
     attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) and all liabilities
     and losses (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA or
     other excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
     settlement) incurred by such person in connection therewith.

          (B)  Additional Indemnified Persons - (1)  Each Additional
     Indemnified Person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
     made a party to or is involved in or called as a witness in any
     Proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the
     Corporation) because he or she is an Additional Indemnified Person
     shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation against
     expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and other
     expenses of litigation) and all liabilities and losses (including, but
     not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA or other excise taxes or
     penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred by
     such person in connection therewith if such Additional Indemnified
     Person acted in Good Faith.  The termination of any Proceeding by
     judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo
     contendere or its equivalent shall not of itself create a presumption
     that an Additional Indemnified Person did not act in Good Faith.

               (2)  Each Additional Indemnified Person who was or is made a
     party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in or
     called as a witness in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of
     the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor because he or she
     is an Additional Indemnified Person shall be indemnified and held
     harmless by the Corporation against expenses (including, but not
     limited to, attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) incurred
     by such person in connection therewith if such Additional Indemnified
     Person acted in Good Faith, except that no indemnification shall be
     made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
     shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in
     the performance of such person's duty to the Corporation unless and
     only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
     or the court in which such Proceeding shall have been brought or is
     pending shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication
     of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such
     Additional Indemnified Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
     indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other
     court shall deem proper.

               (3)  Any indemnification under paragraphs (B)(1) or (B)(2)
     of this Section 1 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
     Corporation unless it is determined that indemnification of the
     Additional Indemnified Person is not proper in the circumstances
     because such person has not met the applicable standard of conduct set
     forth in either paragraph (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this Section 1.  Such
     determination shall be made:  (a) by the Board of Directors of the
     Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who
     are not parties to such Proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not
     obtainable, or, even if obtainable if a quorum of disinterested
     Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
     opinion.  Such determination shall be made within one hundred twenty
     (120) days (or such longer period established as set forth in the next
     sentence) after receipt by the Board of Directors of written notice
     from the Additional Indemnified Person seeking indemnification setting
     forth in reasonable detail the facts known to such person concerning
     the Proceeding.  The period during which the Board of Directors may
     determine that indemnification is not proper may be extended to a
     period established by the Board of Directors by written notice to the
     Additional Indemnified Person delivered to such person within one
     hundred twenty (120) days after receipt by the Board of Directors of
     such person's written notice seeking indemnification.

          (C)  Denial of Authorization for Certain Proceedings -
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article V, except
     with respect to indemnification of Indemnified Persons specified in
     Section 3 of this Article V, the Corporation shall indemnify an
     Indemnified Person or Additional Indemnified Person in connection with
     a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if (i)
     authorization for such Proceeding (or part thereof) was not denied by
     the Board of Directors of the Corporation prior to the earlier of (x)
     sixty (60) days after receipt of notice thereof from such Indemnified
     Person or one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of notice
     thereof from such Additional Indemnified Person, as the case may be,
     or (y) a Change of Control, and (ii) in the case of a Proceeding
     initiated by an Additional Indemnified Person, it is not a Proceeding
     to enforce rights under this Article V.

          (D)  Certain Defined Terms - For purposes of this Article V, the
     following terms shall have the following means (such meanings to be

                     seeking indemnification while serving as a Director
                     who is or was an officer of the Corporation, such
                     person in his capacity as an officer) or (B) an
                     officer, employee or a Delegate, as defined herein,
                     of the Corporation (but, except as included within
                     clause (A), with respect to such officers, employees
                     and Delegates and persons agreeing to become
                     officers, employees or Delegates only as to
                     Proceedings occurring after a Change of Control, as
                     defined herein, arising out of acts, events or
                     omissions occurring prior or subsequent to, or
                     simultaneously with, such Change of Control), or the
                     legal representative or any of the foregoing;

               (iii) a "Delegate" is (A) any employee of the Corporation
                     serving as a director or officer (or in a substan-
                     tially similar capacity) of an entity or enterprise
                     (x) in which the Corporation owns a l0% or greater
                     equity interest or (y) the principal function of
                     which is to service or benefit the Corporation or its
                     licensees; (B) any employee of the Corporation
                     serving as a trustee or fiduciary of an employee
                     benefit plan of the Corporation or any entity or
                     enterprise referred to in clause (A); and (C) any
                     employee serving at the request of the Corporation in

                     the Corporation;

               (iv)  a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have
                     occurred if (A) any "Person" (as that term is used in
                     Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
                     Act of 1934, as amended) is or becomes (except in a
                     transaction approved in advance by the Board of
                     Directors of the Corporation) the beneficial owner
                     (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under such Act), directly
                     or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation
                     representing 20% or more of the combined voting power
                     of the Corporation's then outstanding securities, or
                     (B) during any period of two consecutive years,
                     individuals who at the beginning of such period
                     constitute the Board of Directors of the Corporation
                     cease for any reason to constitute at least a
                     majority thereof unless the election of each Director
                     who was not a Director at the beginning of the period
                     was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
                     Directors then still in office who were Directors at
                     the beginning of the period;

               (v)   an "Additional Indemnified Person" is a person who
                     is, was, or had agreed to become an officer, Delegate
                     or employee of the Corporation and who is not an
                     Indemnified Person; and

               (vi)  "Good Faith" shall mean with respect to any
                     Additional Indemnified Person that such person acted
                     in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
                     believed to be in or not opposed to the best
                     interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to
                     any criminal Proceeding, such person had no
                     reasonable cause to believe such conduct was
                     unlawful.

     Section 2 - Expenses - Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred
     by a person indemnified pursuant to Section 1 of this Article V in
     defending or otherwise being involved in a Proceeding shall be paid by
     the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
     Proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an
     undertaking (the "Undertaking") by or on behalf of such person to
     repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she
     is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation; provided, that
     (A) if a Change of Control has occurred, such person shall be required
     to deliver to the Corporation the Undertaking only if such an
     undertaking is required under the DGCL then in effect, and (B) in
     connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
     person, except a Proceeding authorized by Section 3 of this Article V,
     the Corporation shall pay said expenses in advance of final
     disposition only if authorization for such Proceeding (or part
     thereof) was not denied by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
     prior to the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days in the case of an
     Indemnified Person, or one hundred twenty (120) days in the case of an
     Additional Indemnified Person, after receipt of a request for such
     advancement accompanied by the Undertaking or (ii) a Change of
     Control.  A person to whom expenses are advanced pursuant hereto shall
     not be obligated to repay pursuant to the Undertaking until the final
     determination of any pending Proceeding in a court of competent
     jurisdiction concerning the right of such person to be indemnified or
     the obligation of such person to repay such expenses.

     Section 3 - Protection of Rights - If a claim by an Indemnified Person
     under Section 1 of this Article V is not promptly paid in full by the
     Corporation after a written claim has been received by the Corporation
     or if expenses pursuant to Section 2 of this Article V have not been
     promptly advanced after a written request for such advancement by an
     Indemnified Person (accompanied by the Undertaking if required by
     Section 2 of this Article V) has been received by the Corporation, the
     claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation
     to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or the advancement of
     expenses.  If successful, in whole or in part, in such suit, such
     claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the reasonable expense
     thereof.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an
     action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
     any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
     Undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation (or, if a Change of
     Control has occurred, the Undertaking is not required to be tendered
     to the Corporation under the DGCL) that indemnification of the
     claimant is prohibited by law, but the burden of proving such defense
     shall be on the Corporation.  If a Change of Control has occurred, a
     claimant making a claim under Section 1 of this Article V or seeking
     to avoid repayment to the Corporation of expenses advanced pursuant to
     Section 2 of this Article V shall have (i) the right, but not the
     obligation, to have a determination made by independent legal counsel,
     at the expense of the Corporation, as to whether indemnification of
     the claimant is prohibited by law; and (ii) shall have the right (A)
     to select as independent legal counsel to make such determination any
     legal counsel designated for such purpose in a resolution adopted by
     the Board of Directors that is in full force and effect immediately
     prior to the Change of Control or (B), if the Board of Directors has
     failed to designate any such legal counsel or all such counsel refuse
     to make such a determination, to request the American Arbitration
     Association, at the expense of the Corporation, to select an
     independent legal counsel familiar with matters of the type in dispute
     to make such a determination.  If a determination has been made in
     accordance with the preceding sentence, no determination inconsistent
     therewith by other legal counsel, by the Board of Directors, or by
     stockholders shall be of any force or effect.  Neither the failure of
     the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal
     counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination, if
     required, prior to the commencement of such action that
     indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances, nor an
     actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of
     Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
     indemnification of the claimant is prohibited, shall be a defense to
     the action or create a presumption that indemnification of the
     claimant is prohibited.

     Section 4 - Miscellaneous -

          (A)  Non-Exclusivity of Rights - The rights conferred on any
     person by this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other rights
     which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
     provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote
     of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise.  The Board of
     Directors shall have the authority, by resolution, to provide for such
     indemnification of agents of the Corporation or others and for such
     other indemnification of Directors, officers, Delegates or employees,
     of the Corporation as it shall deem appropriate.

          (B)  Insurance, contracts, and funding - The Corporation may
     maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any
     Director, officer, Delegate, employee, or agent of, the Corporation
     against any expenses, liabilities or losses, whether or not the
     Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
     expenses, liabilities or losses under the DGCL.  The Corporation
     hereby agrees that, for a period of six (6) years after any Change of
     Control, it shall cause to be maintained policies of directors' and
     officers' liability insurance providing coverage at least comparable
     to and in the same amounts as that provided by any such policies in
     effect immediately prior to such Change of Control.  The Corporation
     may enter into contracts with any Director, officer, Delegate or
     employee of the Corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this
     Article V and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or
     use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to
     ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect the
     advancing of expenses and indemnification as provided in this Article
     V.

          (C)  Contractual nature - The provisions of this Article V as
     amended effective December 17, 1990 shall be applicable with respect
     to events, acts and omissions occurring prior to or subsequent to such
     Amendment, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
     Director, officer, Delegate or employee and shall inure to the benefit
     of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.  This
     Article V shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and
     each person who, at any time that this Article V as so amended is in
     effect, serves or agrees to serve in any capacity which entitles him
     to indemnification hereunder and any repeal or other modification of
     this Article V or any repeal or modification of the DGCL or any other
     applicable law shall not limit any rights of indemnification for
     Proceedings then existing or arising out of events, acts or omissions
     occurring prior to such repeal or modification, including, without
     limitation, the right to indemnification for Proceedings commenced
     after such repeal or modification to enforce this Article V with
     regard to Proceedings arising out of acts, omissions or events arising
     prior to such repeal or modification.

          (D)  Cooperation - Each Indemnified Person and Additional
     Indemnified Person shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity
     making the determination with respect to such Indemnified Person's or
     Additional Indemnified Person's entitlement to indemnification under
     this Article V, including providing to such person, persons or entity
     upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which
     is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is
     reasonably available to such Indemnified Person or Additional
     Indemnified Person and reasonably necessary to such determination.
     Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements)
     incurred by such Indemnified Person or Additional Indemnified Person
     in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such
     determination shall be borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the
     determination as to such Indemnified Person's or Additional
     Indemnified Person's entitlement to indemnification) and the
     Corporation hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold such Indemnified
     Person or Additional Indemnified Person harmless therefrom.

          (E)  Subrogation - In the event of any payment under this Article
     V to an Indemnified Person or Additional Indemnified Person, the
     Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all
     of the rights of recovery of such Indemnified Person or Additional
     Indemnified Person, who shall execute all papers required and take all
     action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such
     documents as are necessary to enable the Corporation to bring suit to
     enforce such rights.

          (F)  Severability - If this Article V, or any portion hereof
     shall be invalidated or held to be unenforceable on any ground by any
     court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of which shall not have
     been reversed on appeal, this Article V shall be deemed to be modified
     to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a violation of law and, as so
     modified, this Article V and the remaining provisions hereof shall
     remain valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms to the
     fullest extent permitted by law.

                           ARTICLE VI - MISCELLANEOUS

     Section l - Certificates of Stock - Every holder of stock in the

     Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the
     Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the
     number of shares owned by him in the Corporation.  If such certificate
     is countersigned (l) by a transfer agent or (2) by a registrar, any
     other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any
     officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose
     facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have
     ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such
     certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the
     same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar
     at the date of issue.

     Section 2 - Lost Certificates - A new certificate of stock may be
     issued in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by the
     Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed; and the
     Directors may, in their discretion, require the owner of the lost,
     stolen, or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give
     the Corporation a bond in such sum as they may direct not exceeding
     double the value of the stock to indemnify the Corporation against any
     claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss,
     theft, or destruction of any such certificate, or the issuance of any
     such new certificate.

     Section 3 - Transfer of Shares - The shares of stock of the
     Corporation shall be transferable upon its books by the holders
     thereof in person or by their duly authorized attorneys or legal
     representatives by the surrender of the old certificates duly endorsed
     or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment, or
     authority to transfer, to the Corporation by the delivery thereof to
     the person in charge of the stock and transfer books and ledgers or to
     such other person as the Directors may designate, by whom they shall
     be canceled; and new certificates shall thereupon be issued.  A record
     shall be made of each transfer and a duplicate thereof mailed to the
     Delaware office; and whenever a transfer shall be made for collateral
     security, and not absolutely, it shall be expressed in the entry of
     the transfer.

     Section 4 - Record Date - In order that the Corporation may determine
     the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
     stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to
     Corporate action in writing without a meeting or entitled to receive
     payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
     rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
     conversion, or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other
     lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record
     date which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
     the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which shall
     not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (l0) days before the
     date of such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other
     action.

     Section 5 - Registered Stockholders - The Corporation shall be
     entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on
     its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as
     such owner and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person
     registered on its books as the owner of shares and shall not be bound
     to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share
     or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall
     have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by
     the laws of Delaware.

     Section 6 - Dividends - Subject to the provisions of the Certificate
     of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may, out of funds legally
     available therefor at any regular or special meeting, declare
     dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation as and when they
     deem expedient.  Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in
     shares of the capital stock of the Corporation; and in the case of a
     dividend paid in shares of theretofore unissued capital stock of the
     Corporation, the Board of Directors shall, by resolution, direct that
     there be designated as capital in respect of such shares an amount not
     less than the aggregate par value of such shares and, in the case of
     shares without par value, such amount as shall be fixed by the Board
     of Directors.  Before declaring any dividend, there may be set apart
     out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends, such sum
     or sums as the Directors from time to time in their discretion deem
     proper for working capital or as a reserve fund to meet contingencies
     or for such other purposes as the Directors shall deem conducive to
     the interests of the Corporation.

     Section 7 - Seal - The Corporate seal shall be circular in form and
     shall contain the name of the Corporation, the year of its creation,
     and the words, "CORPORATE SEAL DELAWARE."  Said seal may be used by
     causing it, or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or
     reproduced or otherwise.

     Section 8 - Fiscal Year - The fiscal year of the Corporation shall
     begin on the first day of January in each year and shall end on the
     last day of December in each year.

     Section 9 - Checks - All checks, drafts, or other orders for the
     payment of money, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness issued in
     the name of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or
     officers, agent or agents of the Corporation and in such manner as
     shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of
     Directors.

     Section l0 - Notice and Waiver of Notice - Whenever any notice is
     required by these By-Laws to be given, personal notice is not meant
     unless expressly so stated.  If mailed, notice is given when deposited
     in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
     stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the
     Corporation.  Stockholders not entitled to vote shall not be entitled
     to receive notice of any meetings except as otherwise provided by
     statute.

     Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given under the
     provisions of any law or under the provisions of the Certificate of
     Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws, a waiver thereof in
     writing signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice,
     whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
     equivalent thereto.

     Section 11 - Ratification by Stockholders - Any contract, transaction,
     or act of the Corporation or of the Directors or of any committee
     which shall be ratified by the holders of a majority of the shares of
     stock of the Corporation present in person or by proxy and voting at
     any annual meeting or at any special meeting called for such purpose,
     shall, insofar as permitted by law or under the provisions of the
     Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws, be
     as valid and binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the
     Corporation.

     Section l2 - Interested Directors - No contract or transaction between
     the Corporation and one or more of its Directors or officers or
     between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership,
     association, or other organization in which one or more of its
     Directors or officers are directors or officers or have a financial
     interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason or solely
     because the Director or officer is present at or participates in the
     meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which
     authorizes the contract or transaction or solely because his or their
     votes are counted for such purpose if:

          (l)  the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as
               to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
               the Board of Directors or the committee and the Board or
               committee in good faith authorizes the contract or
               transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
               disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
               directors be less than a quorum; or

          (2)  the material facts as to his relationship or interest and as
               to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
               the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract
               or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by
               vote of the shareholders; or

          (3)  the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as
               of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the
               Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the
               shareholders.

     Common or interested Directors may be counted in determining the
     presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a
     committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.

                            ARTICLE VII - AMENDMENTS

     The By-Laws of this Corporation may be made, altered, amended, or
     repealed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of
     Directors at any regular meeting of the Board of Directors or at any
     special meeting of the Board of Directors if notice of the proposed
     making, alteration, amendment, or repeal to be made is contained in
     the Notice of such special meeting provided, however, that no By-Law
     shall be made, altered, amended, or repealed so as to make such By-Law
     inconsistent with or violative of any provision of the Certificate of
     Incorporation.

                                                              Exhibit 10(a)

                                   McDONALD'S
                             DIRECTORS' STOCK PLAN


                                   Section 1

                                  Introduction

          1.1  The Plan.  McDonald's Corporation (the "Company") first
     established the McDonald's Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the
     "Plan") for the members of its Board of Directors who are not officers
     or employees of the Company ("Outside Directors") on July 1, 1984.
     The Plan was last amended and restated effective December 19, 1991,
     and is hereby amended and restated effective January 19, 1995.
     Effective January 19, 1995, in order to reflect the Plan's focus on
     creating an identity of interest between the Company's Outside
     Directors and its shareholders, the Plan is hereby renamed the
     "Directors' Stock Plan".

          1.2  Purpose.  The purposes of the Plan are:  to advance the
     Company's interests by attracting and retaining well-qualified Outside
     Directors; to provide such individuals with incentives to put forth
     maximum efforts for the long term success of the Company's business;
     and to provide a vehicle to increase the identity of interest between
     Outside Directors and shareholders.


                                   Section 2

                                    Benefits

          2.1  Elected Deferred Benefits.  Each Outside Director may elect
     in accordance with Section 2.7 to defer all or any part of the fees
     received by such Outside Director for service on the Board of
     Directors of the Company (including the annual retainer and Board and
     committee meeting fees) ("Elected Deferred Benefits").

          2.2  Deferred Fee Account.  Elected Deferred Benefits shall be
     credited to an account ("Deferred Fee Account") of each Outside
     Director on a quarterly basis at such a time and in such a manner as
     is reasonably determined by the Controller of the Company and as of
     the date of any distribution pursuant to Section 2.5.  Amounts
     credited to the Deferred Fee Account of each Outside Director shall be
     credited with income, gains and losses in the amounts and at the times
     such as would have occurred if amounts credited to an Outside
     Director's Deferred Fee Account were invested in shares (including
     fractional shares) of common stock of McDonald's Corporation
     ("McDonald's Stock") as of the dates such amounts (including income,
     gains and losses) were credited to the Outside Director's Deferred Fee
     Account.

          2.3  Stock Equivalent Benefit.  In addition to the benefits
     described in Sections 2.1 and  2.2, each Outside Director shall
     receive a stock equivalent benefit which shall be determined in the
     manner described in this Section 2.3  ("Stock Equivalent Benefit").
     On January 19, 1995,  an amount equal to $17,500 multiplied by the<PAGE>
     number of an Outside Director's full years of service (up to a maximum
     of ten years) shall be accrued for such Outside Director's Stock
     Equivalent Benefit.  After January 19, 1995, for each Outside
     Director, an amount equal to $17,500 shall be accrued for such Outside
     Director's Stock Equivalent Benefit at the end of each full year of
     service (up to a maximum of ten years).  In no event shall an Outside
     Director receive a Stock Equivalent Benefit pursuant to this Section
     2.3 which exceeds $175,000 ($17,500 multiplied by 10 years of
     service).  In measuring full years of service, Board service shall
     commence as of the first Board meeting or committee meeting for which
     the Outside Director received compensation and end with the last Board
     meeting or committee meeting for which the Outside Director received
     compensation.  Amounts accrued for an Outside Director's Stock
     Equivalent Benefit shall be adjusted periodically (but no less than
     once each year), at such time or times and in such manner as is
     reasonably determined by the Controller of the Company and as of the
     date of any distribution pursuant to Section 2.5, in order to treat
     each such accrual as though it had been invested in shares of
     McDonald's Stock by reflecting income, gains and losses in the amounts
     and at the times as such would have occurred if an amount equal to
     such accrual were invested in shares (including fractional shares) of
     McDonald's Stock on the date such accrual was made.

          2.4  Value of McDonald's Stock.  The market value of McDonald's
     Stock for purposes hereof on any day shall be the closing price of
     McDonald's Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on such
     day (or, if quotations for McDonald's Stock are not reported on the
     New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on that day, the closing price
     of McDonald's Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on
     the first day preceding such day on which such quotations are so
     reported).

          2.5  Payment of Benefits.  An Outside Director's Deferred Fee
     Account and Stock Equivalent Benefit shall be paid to the Outside
     Director or to such other person as he or she may designate by written
     notice to the Company (or in the event of his or her death to the
     beneficiaries designated by the Outside Director in writing to the
     Secretary of the Board of Directors, or, if the Outside Director fails
     to designate beneficiaries or if all such beneficiaries predecease the
     Outside Director, to the Outside Director's surviving spouse, and if
     none, then to the Outside Director's estate) promptly after the date
     the Outside Director ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors
     because of the expiration of such Outside Director's term, his or her
     resignation from the Board of Directors, or his or her death.  Payment
     shall be made in cash in an amount equal to the total of:  (a) the
     amount credited to the Outside Director's Deferred Fee Account on the
     day preceding the date payment is made, and (b) the Stock Equivalent
     Benefit determined in accordance with Section 2.3 hereof.  To the
     extent that the amount so paid shall be used by such Outside Director
     to purchase shares of McDonald's Stock in the open market within seven
     months after the date such Outside Director ceases to be a member of
     the Board of Directors, the Company shall reimburse such Outside
     Director for all brokerage fees and other transaction costs incurred
     by such Outside Director in connection with such purchase upon
     presentation of reasonably satisfactory evidence thereof.

          2.6  Funding.  Benefits payable under the Plan to any person
     shall be paid directly by the Company.  The Company shall not be<PAGE>
     required to fund or otherwise segregate assets to be used for payment
     of benefits under the Plan.  While the Company may cause investments
     in shares of McDonald's Stock to be made through open market purchases
     in amounts equal or unequal to amounts payable hereunder, the Company
     shall not be under any obligation to make such investments and any
     such investment shall remain subject to the claims of its general
     creditors and the amounts payable to any Outside Directors under the
     Plan shall not be affected by any such investment.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, the Company, in its discretion, may maintain one or
     more trusts to hold assets to be used for payment of benefits under
     the Plan; provided that the assets of such trust shall be subject to
     the creditors of the Company in the event that the Company becomes
     insolvent or is subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.  Any
     payments by such a trust of benefits provided hereunder shall be
     considered payment by the Company and shall discharge the Company of
     any further liability for the payments made by such trust.

          2.7  Deferral Elections.  A person who becomes an Outside
     Director in a year may elect by a written notice delivered to
     McDonald's Corporation within 60 days after becoming an Outside
     Director to receive Elected Deferred Benefits as provided in Section
     2.1 with respect to fees earned in the portion of such year following
     the delivery of such notice to McDonald's Corporation.  Each other
     Outside Director may elect by filing a written election with
     McDonald's Corporation before the beginning of the year to receive
     Elected Deferred Benefits as provided in Section 2.1 for such calendar
     year.  Any election made pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be
     irrevocable.


                                   Section 3

                               General Provisions

          3.1  Plan Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by the
     Committee responsible for administration of the Company's Profit
     Sharing Program.  The Committee shall have, to the extent appropriate,
     the same power, rights, duties and obligations with respect to the
     Plan as it has with respect to the Profit Sharing Program.

          3.2  Retention Rights.  Establishment of the Plan shall not be
     construed to give an Outside Director the right to be retained on the
     Board of Directors or to any benefits not specifically provided by the
     Plan.

          3.3  Interests Not Transferable.  Except as to withholding of any
     tax required under the laws of the United States or any state or
     locality and except with respect to designation of a beneficiary to
     receive benefits in the event of the death of an Outside Director, no
     benefit payable at any time under the Plan shall be subject in any
     manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment,
     or other legal process, or encumbrance of any kind.  Any attempt by an
     Outside Director to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or
     otherwise encumber any such benefits whether current or thereafter
     payable, shall be void.  No benefit shall, in any manner, be liable
     for or subject to the debts or liabilities of any person entitled to
     such benefits.  If any person shall attempt to, or shall alienate,
     sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber his or her<PAGE>
     benefits under the Plan, or if by any reason of his or her bankruptcy
     or other event happening at any time, such benefits would devolve upon
     any other person or would not be enjoyed by the person entitled
     thereto under the Plan, then the Company in its discretion, may
     terminate the interest in any such benefits of the person entitled
     thereto under the Plan and hold or apply them to or for the benefit of
     such person entitled thereto under the Plan or his or her spouse,
     children or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner as the
     Company may deem proper.

          3.4  Amendment and Termination.  Subject to the provisions of
     Section 3.1, the Board intends the Plan to be permanent, but reserves
     the right at any time to modify, amend or terminate the Plan,
     provided, however, that benefits credited as provided herein shall
     constitute an irrevocable obligation of the Company.

          3.5  Controlling Law.  The law of Illinois, except its law with
     respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all manners relating
     to the Plan.

          3.6  Number.  Words in the plural shall include the singular and
     the singular shall include the plural.

          Executed with effect as of the 19th day of January, 1995.

                 MCDONALD'S CORPORATION PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM

          The McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, as
     amended and restated effective January 1, 1987 ("Profit Sharing Plan")
     and subsequently amended from time to time and the McDonald's Matching
     and Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as amended and restated effective
     January 1, 1984 ("McDESOP") and subsequently amended from time to
     time, were merged, effective December 31, 1988, amended and restated
     effective January 1, 1989, and renamed the "McDonald's Corporation
     Profit Sharing Program" (the "Plan").  The Plan as subsequently
     amended from time to time is hereby amended and restated effective
     July 1, 1992.

          The Plan has two component portions, the Profit Sharing Plan
     portion which is intended to be a profit sharing plan and to meet the
     requirements of Sections 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and the
     McDESOP portion which is intended to meet the requirements for a stock
     bonus plan and has two components, a cash or deferred arrangement
     under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and an
     employee stock ownership plan under Sections 401(a) and 4975(e)(7) of
     the Internal Revenue Code.  Each portion of the Plan shall be
     interpreted in a manner consistent with it meeting the requirements of
     the respective Internal Revenue Code Sections applicable thereto.  The
     assets of the employee stock ownership plan portion of the Plan shall<PAGE>
     be invested primarily in qualifying employer securities as defined in
     Section 409(l) of the Internal Revenue Code.

          The purposes of the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program
     are to permit Participants (1) to share in the success of the Company
     by receiving a portion of its profits, (2) to provide employees a
     convenient means to save for their own future retirement security
     through their participation in this Plan and (3) to provide
     Participants individually and as a group with a substantial ownership
     interest in the Company.

          Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Plan as
     amended and restated applies to persons who are Employees on and after
     July 1, 1992.  Eligibility, benefits, payment of benefits and the
     amount of benefits, if any, of a person whose employment with an
     Employer terminated before July 1, 1992 and who is not rehired by an
     Employer on or after July 1, 1992 shall, except as otherwise
     specifically provided herein, be determined in accordance with the
     provisions of the Plan or of McDESOP and the Profit Sharing Plan as in
     effect on the date the person ceased to be an Employee of an Employer.

               that no more than 501 Hours of Service shall be credited for
               any single continuous period of time during which the
               Employee did not or would not have performed duties.

               (b)  (1)  The credit for Hours of Service shall be given for
               the following:

                         (A)  For Plan Years beginning before January 1,
                         1994, an Employee's prior or subsequent employment
                         by a Foreign Affiliate or Domestic Affiliate;

                         (B)  For Plan years beginning after December 31,
                         1993, an Employee's prior or subsequent employment
                         by a Domestic or Foreign Affiliate if the employee
                         is transferred to or from such Domestic or Foreign
                         Affiliate from or to, respectively, the employment

               In determining the number of such Hours of Service to be
               credited, the Plan Administrator shall make good faith
               estimates based upon the available information and records
               including the use of reasonable equivalencies similar to
               those permitted under DOL Reg. Section 2530.200b-3 or
               estimated average number of hours per week for employees in
               a given job category.

               restaurants operated by a Licensee is acquired by the
               Company or another Employer in the first six months of a
               calendar year and if such restaurant or group of restaurants
               is designated as a permanent acquisition by the Company, the
               store managers who are employed by such Licensee either in a
               restaurant or in connection with the operation of one or<PAGE>
               more restaurants as of the date of such acquisition and who
               continue to be employed by the Company or other Employer
               until June 30 of the Plan Year in which the acquisition
               occurred shall be credited by the Employer with his Hours of
               Service with such Licensee.  If a McDonald's Restaurant or
               group of restaurants operated by a Licensee is acquired by
               the Company or another Employer, during the Plan Year, each
               store manager who is employed by such Licensee either in a
               restaurant or in connection with the operation of one or
               more restaurants as of the date of acquisition and continues
               to be employed by the Company or other Employer until the
               last day of the Plan Year in which such acquisition occurred
               who has not already received credit for service with the
               Licensee under the preceding sentence shall as of the last
               day of such Plan Year be credited by the Company or other
               Employer with his Hours of Service with such Licensee.  In
               determining the number of such Hours of Service to be
               credited, the Plan Administrator shall make good faith
               estimates based upon the available information and records
               including the estimated average number of hours per week for
               employees in a given job category.

                    (3)  To the extent an Employee is not otherwise
               credited with Hours of Service for each payroll period while
               on an Authorized Leave of Absence, an Employee shall be
               credited with the number of Hours of Service equal to the
               average number of Hours of Service per payroll period (not
               to exceed forty Hours of Service per week) of such Employee
               for the six calendar week period, or pertinent payroll
               period if such period is longer, ending immediately prior to
               the commencement of the Authorized Leave of Absence
               notwithstanding the limitations of Section 1.31(a)(2).  If a
               Participant is on an Authorized Leave of Absence on the last
               day of a Plan Year, the Hours of Service credited pursuant
               to the preceding sentence shall be counted for the purpose
               of determining whether he is an Active Participant under
               Sections 1.2(a) and (b) for such Plan Year.  Notwithstanding
               the foregoing, an Employee who fails either (A) to return to
               his employment within ninety (90) days after the expiration
               of an Authorized Leave of Absence, or (B) to remain in the
               employ of an Employer after the expiration of an Authorized
               Leave of Absence for the lesser of (i) a period equal to the
               period of his Authorized Leave of Absence or (ii) one year
               following his return to employment, unless such failure
               shall be due to death, Disability, illness, retirement on or
               after age 55 or the sale by the Company, one of its
               subsidiaries or affiliates of the McDonald's Restaurant in
               which such Employee is employed, shall be considered to have
               voluntarily terminated his employment as of the date the
               Leave of Absence commenced for purposes of determining Hours
               of Service for Eligibility Service and Credited Service.

                    (4)  A person who became an Employee on September 16,

               immediately prior to that date was an employee of the
               Special Operations Division of Corporate Systems, Inc. shall
               be credited with Hours of Service pursuant to the foregoing
               provisions of this Section 1.31 as if service with Corporate
               Systems, Inc. were service with the Company.  Such Hours of<PAGE>
               Service shall be credited using actual hours of service for
               hourly paid employees and using the service equivalencies
               provided in Section 1.31(e) for salaried employees.

               (c)  To the extent not otherwise credited in Section 1.31,
          solely for purposes of avoiding a Break in Service, for periods
          of absence from work on account of Parental Leave, an Employee
          shall be credited with Hours of Service as defined below:

               if the Plan is unable to determine the Hours of Service
               which would have been credited to such individual but for
               the Parental Leave.

                    An Employee's Hours of Service for absence on account
          of Parental Leave shall not exceed the lesser of 501 Hours of
          Service or the number of Hours of Service needed to prevent a
          Break in Service and shall be credited to the Eligibility
          Computation Period (for purposes of crediting Eligibility
          Service) or the Plan Year (for purposes of crediting service
          other than Eligibility Service) in which absence because of a
          Parental Leave commenced; except that if such Hours of Service
          are not needed to prevent a Break in Service in the Eligibility
          Computation Period or Plan Year in which absence because of a
          Parental Leave commenced, and the Parental Leave continues into
          the next following Eligibility Computation Period or Plan Year
          then, if needed to prevent a Break in Service, such Hours of
          Service shall be credited to the Eligibility Computation Period
          or Plan Year following the year in which such absence commenced.

               (d)  Hours of Service for reasons other than the performance
          of duties shall, except as provided in Section 1.31(b)(2), be

          provisions of Department of Labor Regulations Section
          2530.200b-2(c).

               (e)  Except as provided in Sections 1.31(b)(2) and 1.31(c)

          for such Employer below:

                    (1)  Staff Contribution.  The amount of an Employer's
               Staff Contribution shall equal the product of (A) the total
               Profit Sharing Contributions for the Plan Year for the
               Participants identified in Section 3.1(a)(1), as determined
               by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3.1(a),
               multiplied by (B) a fraction the numerator of which is the
               total Considered Compensation for such Plan Year of such
               Participants who are (i) Active Participants and
               (ii) Employees of such Employer and the denominator of which
               is the total Considered Compensation for the Plan Year of
               all Active Participants who are Employees of all Employers
               described in Section 3.1(a)(1); and

                    (2)  Crew Contribution.  The amount of an Employer's
               Crew Contribution shall equal the product of (A) the total
               Profit Sharing Contributions for the Plan Year for the
               Participants identified in Section 3.1(a)(2), as determined
               by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3.1(a),
               multiplied by (B) a fraction the numerator of which is the
               total Considered Compensation for such Plan Year of such
               Participants who are (i) Active Participants and
               (ii) Employees of such Employer and the denominator of which
               is the total Considered Compensation for the Plan Year of
               all Active Participants who are Employees of all Employers
               described in Section 3.1(a)(2).<PAGE>

         3.2   Payment of Contributions Made Pursuant to Article III.  The
     Employer Profit Sharing Contributions for each Plan Year shall be paid
     in cash or in securities of McDonald's Corporation, which are
     qualifying employer securities as defined in ERISA Section 407(d)(5)
     (which includes but is not limited to Company Stock), in full not
     later than the due date for filing the federal income tax return of
     the Employer for the tax year during which the last day of such Plan
     Year falls.

          Employer Profit Sharing Contributions and Forfeitures, if any,
     for each Plan Year shall be held in the Profit Sharing Contribution
     Holding Fund and, if contributed in cash, invested in the Money Market
     Fund or, if contributed as qualifying employer securities, remain
     invested in qualifying employer securities until February 1 following
     the Plan Year or, if not administratively feasible, as soon thereafter
     as administrative requirements may warrant, at which time the
     Committee shall allocate such amounts to Participants' Profit Sharing
     Fund Accounts and invest them in accordance with Section 10.7, 10.8 or
     10.11(a), as applicable.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                         McDESOP EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

         4.1   Amount of Employer Matching Contributions.  Employer
     Matching Contributions shall be made by Employers as specified in (a),
     subject to the limitations specified in (b), as follows:

               (a)  Employer Matching Contributions.  For each Plan Year,
          each Employer shall contribute to the Trust as Employer Matching
          Contributions an amount equal to (i) the Matching Amount reduced
          by (ii) the Forfeiture Amount, as defined below:

                    (1)  The Matching Amount shall equal fifty percent (or
               such greater percentage as the Board of Directors from time
               to time determines) of the sum of all Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions (excluding Special Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions as described in Section 5.1) for the
               Plan Year made for Active Participants who are employed by
               that Employer.  If the Forfeiture Amount for a Plan Year is
               greater than the Matching Amount, the Matching Amount shall
               equal the Forfeiture Amount plus any Employer Matching
               Contributions made to the Trust by the Employers for such
               Plan Year.

                    (2)  The Forfeiture Amount shall equal (A) the amount
               of Forfeitures which occur during a Plan Year pursuant to
               Sections 11.4(c) and 16.6, (B) multiplied by a fraction the
               numerator of which is the amount of Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions (excluding Special Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions) made for Active Participants who are
               Employees of such Employer and the denominator of which is
               the total amount of Participant Elected Matched
               Contributions (excluding Special Participant Elected Matched
               Contributions) made for Active Participants for the Plan
               Year.<PAGE>

               Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may
          from time to time determine that each Employer shall make
          Employer Matching Contributions in a designated equal amount for
          the Plan Year or a designated portion of such Plan Year for each
          Participant ("Employer Per Capita Matching Contributions").

               (b)  Average Actual Contribution Percentage.  The average
          actual contribution percentage ("Average ACP") for a specified
          group of Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the
          actual contribution percentages of the persons in such group.  A
          Participant's actual contribution percentage is equal to the
          product of (1) 100 multiplied by (2) the quotient of (A) the sum
          of Employer Matching Contributions including any Forfeitures
          allocated therewith and Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contributions (both to the extent not counted for purposes of the
          Required ADP Test pursuant to Section 5.2(d)) and, if the
          Committee in its discretion so elects, Participant Elected
          Contributions actually paid to the Trust for each such Employee
          for such Plan Year divided by (B) the Employee's Considered
          Compensation for the Plan Year ("Actual Contribution
          Percentage").  As soon as practicable after the end of the Plan
          Year, the Committee shall calculate the Average ACP for the Plan
          Year for the group of Employees eligible to be Active
          Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees and for the
          group of such Employees who are Non-highly Compensated Employees.

               (c)  Required Actual Contribution Percentage Test and
          Adjustment.  The Average ACP for the group of Highly Compensated
          Employees eligible to be Active Participants for any Plan Year
          shall not exceed both (1) and (2) ("Required ACP Test") as
          follows:

                    (1)  the Average ACP for the group of Participants who
               are Non-highly Compensated Employees multiplied by 1.25, and

                    (2)  the lesser of (A) the Average ACP for the group of
               Employees eligible to be Active Participants who are Non-
               highly Compensated Employees multiplied by 2 or (B) such
               Average ACP for such Employees plus 2%.

          If the Required ACP Test for a Plan Year is not met and, if the
          Company does not elect to make Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contributions with respect to the Plan Year sufficient to result
          in the Average ACP of the Highly Compensated Employees not
          exceeding the amounts in both Sections 4.1(c)(1) and (c)(2), then
          the Committee shall reduce Employer Matching Contributions
          including any Forfeitures allocated therewith which may be
          allocated to Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees to
          the highest percentage of Considered Compensation which results
          in the Average ACP of Highly Compensated Employees meeting the
          requirements of Section 4.1(c)(1) or (c)(2) above.  The Committee
          shall reduce and distribute such excess Employer Matching
          Contributions including any Forfeitures allocated therewith and
          any income, gains or losses attributable thereto, as determined
          in accordance with Section 5.3, to Highly Compensated Employees
          by first reducing and distributing the Employer Matching
          Contributions including any Forfeitures allocated therewith of
          such Participants with the highest Actual Contribution Percentage
          to equal that of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next
          highest Actual Contribution Percentage and repeating such<PAGE>
          reductions until the Average ACP for the Highly Compensated
          Employees does not exceed both the amounts in Sections 4.1(c)(1)
          and (c)(2) above.  The Committee shall make any distributions
          necessary for the Plan to meet the Required ACP Test after the
          end of the Plan Year with respect to which such reduced Employer
          Matching Contributions including any Forfeitures allocated
          therewith were made and, if reasonably possible, by March 15
          following the end of such Plan Year but, in any event, not later
          than by the end of the following Plan Year.

         4.2   Auxiliary ESOP Contributions.  Employer Auxiliary ESOP
     Contributions shall be made by Employers, as follows:

               (a)  Company Auxiliary ESOP Contributions.  For each Plan
          Year that a loan authorized under Section 6.1 remains unpaid, the
          Company shall contribute in cash to the Trust, as Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contributions, such amounts (if any) as shall be
          determined by the Board of Directors, provided, however, the
          Company's Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution in cash for any
          Plan Year shall not be less than the product of:

                    (1)  the installment (if any) payable on such loan
               reduced by the dividends on unallocated shares of Company
               Stock (or Company stock into which such shares have been
               converted) held in the suspense account associated with such
               loan (or any loan refinanced with such loan), dividends on
               allocated shares of Company Stock (or Company Stock into
               which such shares have been converted) held in Participants'
               Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts acquired with
               the proceeds of such loan (or any Loan refinanced with such
               loan) and earnings attributable to such dividends and to
               Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions made to repay such
               loan; multiplied by

                    (2)  a fraction, the numerator of which is the
               Considered Compensation paid by the Company to Employees for
               the Plan Year paid while they were Active Participants and
               the denominator of which is the Considered Compensation for
               the Plan Year paid to all Employees while they were Active
               Participants.

          If no installment (as drawn or renegotiated) is payable on a loan
          for the Plan Year, no Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution shall
          be required with respect to such loan for the Plan Year, except
          as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors.  The dividends
          on allocated shares of Company Stock held in Participants'
          Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts acquired with the
          proceeds of a loan or any loan refinanced with such loan (or
          shares into which such Company Stock has been converted) shall be
          included in Section 4.2(a)(1) only to the extent that Employer
          Contributions and the dividends and other income attributable to
          unallocated shares held in the suspense account associated with
          such loan are less than the installments payable or to be payable
          with respect to such loan.

               (b)  Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions.  Each Employer
          that has adopted the Auxiliary ESOP (other than the Company)
          shall contribute to the Trust an amount equal to the product of:<PAGE>

                    (1)  the total Considered Compensation for the Plan
               Year paid by such Employer to Employees while they were
               Active Participants; multiplied by

                    (2)  a fraction the numerator of which is the Employer
               Auxiliary ESOP Contribution of the Company for the Plan Year
               and the denominator of which is the Considered Compensation
               paid by the Company to Employees while they were Active
               Participants.

               (c)  Types of Auxiliary ESOP Contributions.  There shall be
          two types of Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions, determined by
          the type of loan designated by the Board of Directors at the time
          a loan is authorized under Section 6.1 hereof:

                    (1)  Per Capita Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions
               with respect to which amounts released from the Auxiliary
               ESOP Suspense Account (after such released amount is reduced
               by amounts allocated to Participants' Per Capita Employer
               Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts with respect to
               dividends paid on shares of Company Stock held in such
               Accounts and used to repay the loan) shall be allocated to
               Participants' Per Capita Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contribution Accounts in accordance with Section 7.3(a), and

                    (2)  Compensation Based Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contributions with respect to which amounts released from
               the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account (after such released
               amount is reduced by amounts allocated to Participants'
               Compensation Based Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution
               Accounts with respect to dividends paid on shares of Company
               Stock held in such Accounts and used to repay the loan)
               shall be allocated to Participants' Compensation Based
               Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts in accordance
               with Section 7.3(b).

               (d)  Additional Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions.  The
          Board of Directors may, in its discretion, determine that
          Additional Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions shall be made
          for a Plan Year in Company Stock and designate such contributions
          as Per Capita Additional Auxiliary ESOP Contributions or
          Compensation Based Additional Auxiliary ESOP Contributions
          (collectively called "Additional Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contributions").  The Company shall make such Additional Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contributions in an amount equal to the total
          Additional Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution multiplied by a
          fraction the numerator of which is the Considered Compensation
          paid by the Company to Employees for the Plan Year paid while
          they were Active Participants and the denominator of which is the
          Considered Compensation for the Plan Year paid to all Employees
          while they were Active Participants.

               Each Employer that has adopted the Auxiliary ESOP (other
          than the Company) shall contribute to the Trust as Additional
          Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions an amount equal to the
          product of the total Considered Compensation for the Plan Year
          paid by such Employer to Employees while they were Active
          Participants multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
          the Company's Additional Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution and<PAGE>


          the denominator of which is the Compensation paid by the Company
          to Employees while they were Active Participants.

               (e)  Special Dividend Replacement Contributions.  The Board
          of Directors may, in its discretion, determine that Special
          Dividend Replacement Contributions shall be made as of any
          Valuation Date in an amount not to exceed the dividends with
          respect to Company Stock allocated to Participant's Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Accounts which are used pursuant to Section
          6.3(b).  Each Employer shall make any such Special Dividend
          Replacement Contributions in an amount equal to the total amount
          of such contributions to be made as of a Valuation Date
          multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Considered
          Compensation paid to Active Participants who are Employees of the
          Employer for the calendar quarter ending on the Valuation Date
          and the denominator of which is the Considered Compensation paid
          to all Active Participants during the calendar quarter ending on
          the Valuation Date.

               (f)  Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account.  All Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contributions made with respect to a loan shall be
          held and accounted for within the separate Auxiliary ESOP
          Suspense Account associated with such loan.

         4.3   Annual Employer Contribution Elections.

               (a)  Minimum and Maximum Amount of Participant Elected
          Matched Contributions.  Prior to January 1, 1993, an Active
          Participant may elect a Special Participant Elected Matched
          Contribution in the amount of $1 per week to commence to be made
          to the Trust on his behalf.  Once elected, such Special
          Participant Elected Matched Contributions shall continue for so
          long as the Participant is an Active Participant until the
          Participant elects to discontinue such contributions.

               If Participant Elected Matched Contributions (in addition to
          Special Participant Elected Matched Contributions made prior to
          January 1, 1993) are to be permitted for all or any portion of a
          Plan Year, the Company by action of its Board of Directors shall
          specify for the Plan Year or portion of the Plan Year, the amount
          (either as a dollar amount or a percentage of each Active
          Participant's Considered Compensation) of such Participant
          Elected Matched Contributions ("Specified Participant Elected
          Matched Contributions") which shall be made on behalf of an
          Active Participant in the absence of a contrary election by the
          Participant and may also specify, the minimum and maximum amounts
          of Participant Elected Matched Contributions which a Participant
          may elect in lieu of Specified Participant Elected Matched
          Contributions (either as a dollar amount or a percentage of each
          Participant's Considered Compensation) for the Plan Year or
          portion of the Plan Year as permitted by procedures established
          by the Plan Administrator, provided that such minimum and maximum
          amounts shall be not greater for any Plan Year than

               (1)  prior to to January 1, 1993, one dollar ($1) per week
                    plus

                    (A)  five percent (5%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a staff or an executive
               employee or a store manager,<PAGE>

                    (B)  ten percent (10%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a Certified Swing Manager
               or primary maintenance employee, and

                    (C)  eight percent (8%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a crew member or other
               hourly restaurant employee; and

               (2)  on or after January 1, 1993 and prior to January 1,
               1994

                    (A)  five percent (5%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a staff or an executive
               employee or a store manager,

                    (B)  ten percent (10%) of the Participant's
               Compensation if the Participant is a Certified Swing Manager
               or primary maintenance employee, and

                    (C)  eight percent (8%) of the Participant's
               Compensation if the Participant is a crew member or other
               hourly restaurant employee; and

               (3)  on or after January 1, 1994

                    (A)  six percent (6%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a staff or an executive
               employee or a store manager,

                    (B)  ten percent (10%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a Certified Swing Manager
               or primary maintenance employee, and

                    (C)  eight percent (8%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a crew member or other
               hourly restaurant employee.

               (b)  Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions.  For
          each Plan Year, the Company may elect to have the Company and the
          other Employers make a Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contribution to the Plan in such amount (if any) as the Board of
          Directors may determine, which shall be allocated pursuant to
          Section 7.2(b) to the Employer Matching Contribution Accounts of
          those Active Participants who for the Plan Year are Non-highly
          Compensated Employees who have Compensation reduction elections
          in effect.  In any Plan Year in which the Company elects to have
          such a Special Section 401(k) Employer Contribution made, each
          Employer, including the Company, shall contribute a fractional
          portion of the Special Section 401(k) Employer Contribution, in
          an amount equal to the Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contribution multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
          the amount of Participant Elected Contributions for such Plan
          Year of those Active Participants who are employed by the
          Employer and who are Non-highly Compensated Employees, and the
          denominator of which is the amount of Participant Elected
          Contributions for the Plan Year of all Active Participants who
          are Non-highly Compensated Employees.<PAGE>

         4.4   Additional Employer Contributions.  For such Plan Years, if
     any, as the Board of Directors shall direct, the Employers shall make
     Additional Employer Contributions in an amount to be determined by the
     Board of Directors.  Each such Employer shall contribute Additional
     Employer Contributions to the Trust for a Plan Year in an amount equal
     to the total Additional Employer Contributions for such Plan Year
     multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
     Active Participants eligible to receive Additional Employer
     Contributions who are Employees of the Employer and the denominator of
     which is the total number of Active Participants eligible to receive
     Additional Employer Contributions.

         4.5   Payment of Contributions Made Pursuant to Article IV.
     Employer Contributions for each Plan Year made in accordance with
     Article IV, except for Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions
     as provided in Section 4.3(b), shall be delivered to the Trustee on or
     before the due date for the filing of the federal income tax return
     (including any extensions) of the Employer for the tax year during
     which the last day of such Plan Year occurs.  Special Section 401(k)
     Employer Contributions for a Plan Year may be made during the Plan
     Year or at any time on or before the last day of the following Plan
     Year.

     Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated
     therewith, Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions and
     Additional Employer Contributions shall be invested in the McDESOP
     McDonald's Common Stock Fund and held in the Employer Matching
     Contribution Holding Fund until allocated to Participant's Accounts as
     provided in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b) and 7.2(c), respectively.
     Employer Per Capita Matching Contributions shall be invested in the
     McDESOP McDonald's Common Stock Fund and held in the Employer Per
     Capita Matching Contribution Holding Fund until allocated to
     Participant's Accounts as provided in Section 7.2(d).  Participant
     Elected Contributions shall be invested in the McDESOP McDonald's
     Common Stock Fund and held in the Participant Elected Contribution
     Holding Fund until credited to Participant's Accounts as provided in
     Section 7.4.

         4.6   Form of Contributions.  Except as otherwise provided,
     Employer Contributions to the McDESOP Trust shall be either in cash or
     in Company Stock, as each Employer shall determine in its discretion.


                                   ARTICLE V

                       PARTICIPANT ELECTED CONTRIBUTIONS

         5.1   Participant Elected Contributions.  Each Active Participant,
     who is employed by an Employer, shall have his Considered Compensation
     reduced for each Plan Year or designated portion of a Plan Year by an
     amount equal to the Specified Participant Elected Matched Contribution
     for the Plan Year or designated portion of a Plan Year, as provided in
     Section 4.3(a), which amount his Employer shall contribute to the
     McDESOP Trust on the Participant's behalf as a Participant Elected
     Matched Contribution, unless the Participant shall elect, on such
     form, at such time and in such manner as the Committee shall specify,
     not to have his Considered Compensation so reduced or (subject to the
     minimum and maximum amounts of reduction specified for the Plan Year
     pursuant to Section 4.3(a)) reduced by a lesser or greater amount. In
     addition, each Active Participant may elect in writing on forms<PAGE>
     approved by the Committee to have his Employer contribute to the
     McDESOP Trust on the Participant's behalf as Participant Elected
     Unmatched Contributions an amount equal to any additional amount by
     which the Participant elects to have his Considered Compensation
     reduced (which election may be a larger percentage for certain
     Considered Compensation during a Plan Year, e.g. bonus, and a smaller
     percentage for other Considered Compensation, e.g. salary, as the
     Committee shall permit), provided that such amount may not exceed (i)
     prior to January 1, 1993, five percent (5%), and (ii) on or after
     January 1, 1993, seven percent (7%) of his Considered Compensation for
     a Plan Year and further provided that an Active Participant may elect
     Participant Elected Unmatched Contributions as provided above
     regardless of whether the Participant is making Participant Elected
     Matched Contributions for that period. The Committee may from time to
     time establish general policies requiring Participants to elect
     Participant Elected Matched Contributions up to a specified level
     before electing any Participant Elected Unmatched Contributions.

     Prior to January 1, 1993, each Participant may elect to have his
     Considered Compensation reduced by one dollar ($1.00) per week as
     provided in Section 4.3(a) which his Employer shall contribute to the
     McDESOP Trust on his behalf as a Special Participant Elected Matched
     Contribution and may elect to discontinue such contributions.  Such
     Special Participant Elected Matched Contributions shall be treated as
     Participant Elected Matched Contributions for all purposes hereunder
     except that Special Participant Elected Contributions shall not be
     counted as Participant Elected Matched Contributions for the purpose
     of applying the limit of five percent (5.0%) of a Participant's
     Considered Compensation applicable to Participant Elected Matched
     Contributions.

     Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the amount of a
     Participant's Participant Elected Contributions for any calendar year
     shall not exceed an amount or percentage which from time to time is
     established by the Committee or the Board of Directors, nor a pro rata
     portion of said amount for any partial calendar year of contributions.

          Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, a Participant
     may make, change or revoke a Compensation reduction election at such
     times and in such manner as the Committee may permit, provided that
     any such election, change or revocation shall apply solely to
     Considered Compensation, which is not currently available to the
     Participant as of the date of such election, change or revocation.
     The Compensation reduction election by the Active Participant which is
     in accordance with the Plan shall continue in effect, notwithstanding
     any change in Considered Compensation, until he shall change such
     Compensation reduction election or until he shall cease to be an
     Active Participant.  If a Participant has an election pursuant to the
     McDonald's 1989 Executive Equalization Plan ("McCap I") or the
     McDonald's Supplemental Employee Benefit Equalization Plan
     ("McCap II") in effect for a calendar year, the Participant's
     Compensation reduction election hereunder may not be changed for such
     year but may only be changed before the beginning of the following
     Plan Year for such Plan Year.  Each Employer shall make Participant
     Elected Contributions to the Trustee on behalf of each Active
     Participant employed by the Employer in the amount by which the
     Participant's Considered Compensation was reduced pursuant to this
     Section 5.1.<PAGE>

         5.2   Restrictions on Participant Elected Contributions.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1, the following
     restrictions shall apply to Participant Elected Contributions:

               (a)  No Participant Compensation reduction election shall be
          solicited or accepted from any Participant and no Participant
          Elected Contributions shall be made on behalf of any Participant
          unless and until a registration statement under the Securities
          Act of 1933 has become effective with respect to securities
          offered in connection with the Plan, unless in the opinion of
          counsel for the Company such registration statement is not
          required;

               (b)  No Compensation reduction election shall be solicited
          or accepted from any Participant who resides or works in any
          state and no Participant Elected Contributions shall be made on
          behalf of any Participant who resides or works in any state
          unless and until the Plan shall have complied with applicable
          securities and blue sky laws of the state or in the opinion of
          counsel of the Company is exempt from such law; and

               (c)  (1)  The sum of Participant Elected Contributions and
               of elected deferrals under any Related Defined Contribution
               Plan for any Participant shall in no event exceed a maximum
               of $8,728 (in 1992 as adjusted from time to time, in
               accordance with Section 402(g)(5) of the Internal Revenue
               Code) for a calendar year ("Maximum Elective Deferral
               Amount").

                    (2)  If the Participant notifies the Committee in
               writing by March 1 following the Plan Year or such later
               date not later than the April 15 following the Plan Year as
               the Committee shall permit, that the sum of his elective
               contributions to a simplified employer pension, to a 403(b)
               plan (as defined in Section 402(g)(3) of the Internal
               Revenue Code), or to any qualified cash or deferred
               arrangement (as defined in Section 401(k) of the Internal
               Revenue Code) exceeds the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount
               ("Excess Elected Deferrals"), such portion of the
               Participant's Participant Elected Contributions as the
               Participant shall elect in such notice not to exceed the
               amount of such Excess Elected Deferrals (including any
               income allocated thereto as determined in accordance with
               Section 5.3) shall be distributed to the Participant not
               later than the April 15 following the Plan Year.  In
               determining whether a Participant has made Excess Elected
               Deferrals under this Section 5.2(c)(2), if a Participant is
               a participant in any plan described in Section 403(b) of the
               Internal Revenue Code under which he makes elective
               deferrals, the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount shall be
               increased in accordance with the provisions of Sections
               402(g)(4) and 402(g)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code with
               respect to any Participant who participates in a plan
               described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code or
               who is a qualified employee in a plan of a qualified
               organization (as defined in Section 402(g)(8) of the
               Internal Revenue Code) for a calendar year.

                    (3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant
               has elected to participate in McCAP I or McCAP II as<PAGE>
               provided therein his Compensation reduction elections
               hereunder shall be irrevocable to the extent provided in
               Section 5.1 and any amount of such deferrals which shall be
               in excess of the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount and any
               Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures
               allocated therewith shall not be contributed hereunder but
               shall be credited to the Participant's account under McCAP I
               or McCAP II, as applicable, to the extent provided
               thereunder and further provided that no such amount shall be
               credited to a Participant under more than one of the
               McDonald's Profit Sharing Program Equalization Plan
               ("McEqual"), McCAP I and McCAP II or any other non-qualified
               deferred compensation plan from time to time maintained by
               the Company.

                    (4)  If a Participant is not eligible to or has not
               elected to participate in McCAP I or McCAP II as provided
               therein and has Compensation reduction elections in excess
               of the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount hereunder, such
               Participant Elected Contributions shall not be contributed
               to the Plan nor shall such Participant be credited with any
               Participant Elected Contributions or Employer Matching
               Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith under
               McCAP I or McCAP II, as applicable, for the Plan Year.

                    (5)  In determining whether the Maximum Elective
               Deferral Amount has been exceeded, the Plan Administrator
               may count Participant Elected Contributions toward the limit
               in the order contributed to the Plan, may apply the Maximum
               Elective Deferral Amount on a pro rata basis to periods
               specified by the Plan Administrator or such other approach
               as the Plan Administrator shall reasonably determine.

               (d)  Average Actual Deferral Percentage.  The average Actual
          Deferral Percentage ("Average ADP") for a specified group of
          Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the Actual
          Deferral Percentages of the members of such group.  The Actual
          Deferral Percentage of an individual is the amount of his
          Participant Elected Contributions (excluding for each Non-highly
          Compensated Employee any such contributions in excess of the
          Maximum Elective Deferral Amount as defined in Section 5.2(c)(1))
          and such portion, if any, as the Committee determines, of
          Employer Matching Contributions and Special Section 401(k)
          Employer Contributions, actually paid to the Trust for each such
          Employee for such Plan Year divided by the Employee's Considered
          Compensation for the Plan Year ("Actual Deferral Percentage").
          As soon as practicable after the end of the Plan Year, the
          Committee shall calculate the Average ADP for the Plan Year for
          the group of Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees
          and for the group of Participants who are Non-highly Compensated
          Employees.

               (e)  Required ADP Test and Adjustment.  The Average ADP for
          a group of Highly Compensated Employees eligible to be Active
          Participants for any Plan Year shall not exceed both (1) and (2)
          ("Required ADP Test") below:

                    (1)  the Average ADP for the group of Active
               Participants who are Non-highly Compensated Employees
               multiplied by 1.25, and<PAGE>

                    (2)  the lesser of (A) the Average ADP for Active
               Participants who are Non-highly Compensated Employees
               multiplied by 2 or (B) such Average ADP for such Active
               Participants plus 2%.

               If the Required ADP Test for a Plan Year is not met and, if
          the Company does not elect to make Special Section 401(k)
          Contributions with respect to the Plan Year sufficient to result
          in the Average ADP of the Highly Compensated Employees not
          exceeding both the amounts in Sections 5.2(e)(1) and (e)(2), then
          the Committee shall reduce, in accordance with Section 5.5,
          Participant Elected Contributions (and any Employer Matching
          Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith allocated
          with respect thereto) that Active Participants who are Highly
          Compensated Employees may defer so that the Average ADP of Highly
          Compensated Employees does not exceed the amounts in
          Sections 5.2(e)(1) and (e)(2).

               The Committee shall reduce and distribute such excess
          Participant Elected Contributions and any income, gains or losses
          attributable thereto, as determined in accordance with
          Section 5.3, to Highly Compensated Employees by first reducing
          the Participant Elected Contributions (and any Employer Matching
          Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith) of such
          Participants with the highest Actual Deferral Percentage to equal
          that of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest
          Actual Deferral Percentage and repeating such reductions until
          the ADP for the Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the
          amounts in both Section 5.2(e)(1) and (e)(2) above.  The
          Committee shall distribute such reduced Participant Elected
          Contributions and any income allocable thereto after the end of
          the Plan Year with respect to which such reduced Participant
          Elected Contributions were made and, if reasonably possible, by
          March 15 following the end of such Plan Year but, in any event,
          not later than by the end of the following Plan Year.  If
          Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated
          therewith are included in calculating the ADP for a Plan Year,
          any such contributions reduced hereunder shall be distributed to
          Participants in the same manner as Participant Elected
          Contributions are distributed (including any income allocable
          thereto).  If Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures
          allocated therewith are not included in calculating the ADP for
          Plan Year, any amount of Employer Matching Contributions and any
          forfeitures allocated therewith reduced hereunder because such
          contributions were originally allocated with respect to
          Participant Elected Matched Contributions which are reduced to
          meet the Required ADP Test shall become a Forfeiture and shall be
          allocated to other Participant's Employer Matching Contribution
          Accounts in proportion to the Employer Matching Contributions and
          any Forfeitures allocated therewith to such accounts pursuant to
          Sections 7.2(a) and (d).

         5.3   Allocation of Income to Certain Distributed Amounts.
     Income, gains and losses equal to the sum of the amounts determined
     under (a) below shall be allocated to and distributed with any amounts
     distributed to a Participant pursuant to Sections 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or
     5.4 as follows:<PAGE>

               (a)  Income for Plan Year.  Income, gains and losses for a
          completed Plan Year with respect to contributions distributed in
          accordance with Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4 shall equal the
          income, gains and losses for the Plan Year allocable to a
          Participant's Account for such contributions (taking the
          contributions allocated to each different type of Account,
          separately) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
          the amount of such contributions so distributed and the
          denominator of which is the total of such Account balance as of
          the last day of the Plan Year reduced by all earnings and gains
          and increased by all expenses and losses allocable to such
          Account for the Plan Year.

               (b)  Allocation of Distributed Income to Accounts.  Income,
          gains and losses distributed with any amounts distributed to a
          Participant pursuant to Sections 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4 shall
          reduce the income, gains and losses allocated to a Participant's
          Elected Contribution Account or Employer Matching Contribution
          Account, in accordance with Section 10.15, in an amount equal to
          the total amount of such income, gains and losses distributed.

         5.4   Multiple Use of Alternative Limitations.  If after any
     reductions provided for in Sections 4.1(c) and 5.2(e) are made, the
     ACP of Highly Compensated Employees exceeds the amount in Section
     4.1(c)(1) but does not exceed the lesser of the amounts in Section
     4.1(c)(2) and the Average ADP of Highly Compensated Employees exceeds
     the amount in Section 5.2(e)(1) but does not exceed the lesser of the
     amounts in Section 5.2(e)(2), the sum of the Average ADP and the
     Average ACP, for a Plan Year, of the Highly Compensated Employees who
     are Active Participants (i) shall not exceed the greater of (a) or
     (b), where:

               (a)  equals the sum of (1) plus (2) where:

                    (1)  is one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of
               the greater of (A) the Average ADP for such Plan Year of the
               Non-Highly Compensated Employees who are Active
               Participants, or (B) the Average ACP for such Plan Year of
               such Non-Highly Compensated Employees; and

                    (2)  is two percent plus the lesser of the amount
               determined under Section 5.4(a)(1)(A) or the amount
               determined under Section 5.4(a)(1)(B), but in no event shall
               this amount exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the lesser
               of the amounts determined under Section 5.4(a)(1)(A) or
               5.4(a)(1)(B); and

               (b)  equals the sum of (1) plus (2) where

                    (1)  is one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of
               the lesser of (A) the Average ADP for such Plan Year of the
               Non-Highly Compensated Employees who are Active
               Participants, or (B) the Average ACP for such Plan Year of
               such Non-Highly Compensated Employees; and

                    (2)  is two percent plus the greater of the amount
               determined under Section 5.4(b)(1)(A) or 5.4(b)(1)(B).  In
               no event, however, shall this amount exceed 200 percent of
               the greater of the amounts determined under
               Section 5.4(b)(1)(A) or 5.4(b)(1)(B).<PAGE>

     The Committee may establish, from time to time, such rules,
     restrictions and limitations as it may deem appropriate to insure that
     the above limitations are met.  If the Committee determines that the
     reduction or disallowance of Employer Matching Contributions and any
     Forfeitures allocated therewith, Participant elections or Participant
     Elected Contributions is necessary or desirable with respect to Highly
     Compensated Employees, the Committee may reduce or disallow Employer
     Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith or
     Participant Elected Contributions and the income, gains and losses
     thereon as determined pursuant to Section 5.3 for such Highly
     Compensated Employees, including elections for Participant Elected
     Contributions or such contributions and Employer Matching
     Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith already made for
     the Plan Year, as provided in Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.5.

         5.5   Excess Compensation Reduction Elections.  Participant
     Elected Contributions for any Participant or group of Participants
     shall not exceed the maximum amounts permitted under Sections 4.1(c),
     5.2(e) and 5.4, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
     If any amounts of Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures
     allocated therewith of any Participant or group of Participants are
     determined by the Committee to be in excess of the amounts permitted
     under Section 4.1(c) or 5.4, or if any amounts of Participant Elected
     Contributions for any Participant or group of Participants are
     determined by the Committee to be in excess of the amounts permitted
     under Section 5.2(e) or 5.4 and if the Company has not elected to make
     Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions with respect to the Plan
     Year sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e)
     or 5.4 or if the Committee reasonably expects that Employer Matching
     Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith or Participant
     Elected Contributions will be in excess of the amounts permitted under
     Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4, the Committee may apply one or both of
     (a) and (b) below to the extent the Committee, in its discretion,
     reasonably estimates to be necessary to satisfy Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e)
     or 5.4.

               (a)  Restrictions on Participant Elected Contributions.  The
          Committee may, in accordance with uniform and non-discriminatory
          rules from time to time established by the Committee, reduce
          prospectively the amount of the Participant Elected Contributions
          which may be made by an Employer to the McDESOP Trust on behalf
          of Active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees by
          reducing the Participant's elections for such contribution to the
          extent the Committee reasonably determines it is necessary to
          satisfy Section 5.2(e) or 5.4.

               (b)  Staggered and Limited Elections for Highly Compensated
          Employees.  The Committee may, in accordance with uniform and
          non-discriminatory rules it establishes from time to time,
          require that Active Participants who are among the Highly
          Compensated Employees for the Plan Year make Compensation
          reduction elections following and/or preceding the completion of
          such elections by Employees who are Non-highly Compensated
          Employees and the Committee may (1) limit the amount by which
          each Participant who is among the Highly Compensated Employees
          may elect to reduce his Considered Compensation, and (2) permit
          each Employee who is a Non-highly Compensated Employee to elect
          to reduce his Considered Compensation within higher limits than
          those for Highly Compensated Employees.<PAGE>

               (c)  Estimated Compensation.  For the purposes of
          Section 5.5(a) and (b), Employers are permitted to determine that
          Participants are Highly Compensated Employees or Non-highly
          Compensated Employees based on the Participant's Considered
          Compensation for the immediately preceding Plan Year or estimated
          Considered Compensation for the current Plan Year in accordance
          with uniform and nondiscriminatory rules whenever information
          regarding actual Considered Compensation for the Plan Year is not
          reasonably available at the time the amount of a contribution
          hereunder is determined or limited; provided that subsequent
          adjustments shall be made, as necessary, to the extent such
          estimates prove to be incorrect.

         5.6   Deadline for Participant Elected Contributions.  Each
     Employer shall contribute on behalf of each Active Participant the
     Participant Elected Contributions for each Plan Year to the Trustee as
     soon as administratively possible as of the earliest date on which
     such contributions can reasonably be segregated from the Employer's
     general assets but not later than the earlier of (1) 90 days from the
     date on which such amounts would otherwise have been payable to the
     Active Participant in cash or (2) the end of the twelve-month period
     immediately following the last day of such Plan Year or by such later
     date as may be permitted under applicable law, Treasury Regulations
     and Rulings of the Internal Revenue Service.

         5.7   Application of the Limitations of Sections 5.2(c), 5.2(e),
     4.1(c), 5.4 and 9.1.  Section 5.2(c) shall be first applied to
     contributions under the Plan, secondly, Section 5.2(e) shall be
     applied to contributions under the Plan, thirdly, Section 4.1(c) shall
     be applied to contributions under the Plan, fourthly, Section 5.4
     shall be applied to contributions under the Plan, and lastly,
     Section 9.1 shall be applied to contributions under the Plan.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                           AUXILIARY ESOP PROVISIONS

         6.1   Power to Borrow.  The Board of Directors in its discretion
     may authorize the Trustee of the Trust to borrow funds on behalf of
     the Plan for the purpose of purchasing Company Stock and for making
     repayment of outstanding loans, the proceeds of which have been used
     to purchase Company Stock and for which the Plan is liable.  At the
     time of authorizing a loan, the Board of Directors shall specify
     whether the loan is to be a loan to be repaid with Per Capita Employer
     Auxiliary ESOP Contributions ("Per Capita Loan") or Compensation Based
     Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions ("Compensation Based Loan").  In
     the event the Trustee's borrowing shall cause a lending of money or
     other extension of credit to be made between the Plan and a
     Disqualified Person or a Party in Interest or, if in connection with
     such borrowing, a Disqualified Person or Party in Interest shall
     guarantee a loan or other extension of credit to the Plan, such loan
     or other extension of credit to the Plan shall, as an "Exempt Loan,"
     meet the requirements of Section 4975(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue
     Code and Section 408(b)(3) of ERISA and regulations thereunder, which
     include the following:

               (a)  The loan shall be for a specific term and not payable
          upon demand except in the event of default;<PAGE>

               (b)  The loan is primarily for the benefit of Participants
          and Beneficiaries, at a reasonable rate of interest, and under
          terms at the time the loan is made which are at least as
          favorable to the Plan as the terms of a comparable loan resulting
          from arms-length negotiations between independent parties;

               (c)  The proceeds of the loan must be used within a
          reasonable time after their receipt to acquire Company Stock or
          for making repayment of an outstanding Exempt Loan;

               (d)  The loan shall be without recourse against the Plan and
          collateral for the loan shall be limited to the shares of Company
          Stock acquired with the proceeds of the loan (or Company Stock
          into which such shares have been converted) or used as collateral
          on an outstanding Exempt Loan which is being repaid with the
          proceeds of the loan.  No person entitled to payment under the
          loan shall have any right to any assets of the Plan other than
          the collateral, Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions (excluding
          contributions of Company Stock), earnings on such collateral and
          contributions (including but not limited to dividends paid on
          unallocated Company Stock held in the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense
          Account) and dividends on Company Stock (or Company Stock into
          which such shares have been converted) acquired with the loan
          proceeds and held in Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contribution Accounts;

               (e)  In the event of a default upon the loan, the value of
          the Plan assets transferred in satisfaction of the loan shall not
          exceed the amount of the default and, if the lender is a Party in
          Interest or Disqualified Person, shall not exceed an amount of
          Plan assets equal to the amount of the payment schedule with
          respect to which there is a failure to pay; and

               (f)  The loan may provide that there shall be no required
          payments of principal and/or interest for one or more years and
          the Company may from time to time request the Trustee to
          renegotiate any such loan to change the payment terms with
          respect to payments not then due and payable, to extend the
          period of payment, or to reduce or eliminate the amount of any
          payment or payments of principal and/or interest not then due and
          payable.

          These rules shall be changed by amendment to the Plan to the
     extent changes in applicable law require or permit.

         6.2   Accounting for Loan Proceeds and Employer Auxiliary ESOP
     Contributions.  The Committee shall establish with respect to each
     loan a separate Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account to record and
     separately account for:  (a) the proceeds of each loan or other
     extension of credit authorized under Section 6.1 and any unallocated
     Company Stock purchased with proceeds of such a loan or any loan
     refinanced with such loan (and any Company Stock into which such
     purchased shares have been converted), (b) Employer Auxiliary ESOP
     Contributions with respect to such loan, (c) any income, gains or
     losses allocated to the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account with respect
     to such loan and (d) any dividends from shares of Company Stock
     purchased (and Company Stock into which such purchased shares have
     been converted) with the proceeds of the loan (or any loan refinanced
     with such loan) which have been allocated to Participants' Accounts<PAGE>
     and transferred to the Suspense Account.  Subject to the discretion of
     the Trustee to reinvest proceeds from the sale of Company Stock
     pursuant to Section 6.4(b), earnings of the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense
     Account with respect to a loan shall be used to repay the loan, and to
     the extent not so used shall be released and allocated under
     Section 6.3 hereof.  Assets shall be released from the Auxiliary ESOP
     Suspense Account only in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3
     or to repay a loan or for reinvestment in Company Stock pursuant to
     Section 6.4(b), provided, however, proceeds of an Exempt Loan may not
     be used to repay any loan which is not an Exempt Loan.

         6.3   Release from Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account.

               (a)  Loan Repayment Release.  Company Stock acquired with
          the proceeds of an Exempt Loan, or other loan authorized under
          Section 6.1 or a loan refinanced with such Exempt Loan or other
          loan (and Company Stock into which such purchased shares have
          been converted) and held in the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account
          under Section 6.2 shall be released as of the last Valuation Date
          of a Plan Year immediately following the release under
          Section 6.3(b) for such Valuation Date for allocation to Per
          Capita Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts or
          Compensation Based Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts,
          as applicable, of each Active Participant in accordance with the
          provisions of Section 6.3(a)(1) below, unless such loan provides
          for the annual payment of principal and interest at a cumulative
          rate that is not less rapid at any time than level annual
          payments of such amounts for ten (10) years, and the interest
          paid on such loan is determined under standard loan amortization
          tables, in which case such Company Stock shall be released in
          accordance with Section 6.3(a)(1) or (2) below, as may be
          selected by the Board of Directors in its discretion at the time
          such loan is made; provided, however, if such loan is renewed,
          extended or refinanced, and if the sum of the expired duration of
          the loan, any renewal period, extension period, and the duration
          of the refinancing exceeds ten (10) years, determined as of the
          date of the renewal, extension or refinancing, Section 6.3(a)(1)
          shall apply:

                    (1)  Each Plan Year in which any amount remains
               outstanding under an Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized
               under Section 6.1), the number of shares of Company Stock
               released from the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account shall
               equal the difference between (A) the product (rounded upward
               to the nearest whole number of shares) of the number of
               shares of Company Stock held and accounted for under the
               Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account immediately before the
               release increased by the number of shares, if any,
               previously released from the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account
               in accordance with Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year with
               respect to such loan, multiplied by a fraction, the
               numerator of which is the amount of principal and interest
               paid on the Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under
               Section 6.1) for the Plan Year and the denominator of which
               is the sum of the numerator plus the principal and interest
               to be paid for all future Plan Years (without consideration
               of possible extensions or renewal periods) reduced by
               (B) the number of shares, if any, previously released from
               the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account in accordance with
               Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year with respect to such loan.<PAGE>
               If the interest rate under the Exempt Loan (or other loan
               authorized under Section 6.1) is variable, the interest to
               be paid in future Plan Years shall be computed by using the
               interest rate applicable as of the end of the Plan Year of
               payment.

                    (2)  For each Plan Year during the duration of an
               Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1),
               the number of shares of Company Stock released from the
               Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account shall equal the difference
               between (A) the product of the number of shares of Company
               Stock held and accounted for under the Auxiliary ESOP
               Suspense Account immediately before the release increased by
               the number of shares, if any, previously released from the
               Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account in accordance with
               Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year with respect to such loan,
               multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
               amount of principal paid on the Exempt Loan (or other loan
               authorized under Section 6.1) for the Plan Year and the
               denominator of which is the sum of the numerator plus the
               principal to be paid for all future years reduced by (B) the
               number of shares, if any, previously released from the
               Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account in accordance with Section
               6.3(b) for the Plan Year with respect to such loan.

               If subsection (1) is applicable and if no amount of
          principal and interest is paid with respect to a loan for the
          Plan Year, or if subsection (2) is applicable and no amount of
          principal is paid for the Plan Year, there shall be no release of
          shares of Company Stock from the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account
          maintained with respect to such loan for the Plan Year in
          accordance with Section 6.3(a).  If an Exempt Loan (or other loan
          authorized under Section 6.1) is repaid as a result of a
          refinancing by another Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized
          under Section 6.1), such repayment shall not be considered a
          repayment of principal under Sections 6.3(a)(1) and (2) and the
          release of shares shall be determined as provided in Section
          6.3(a)(1) and (2), by aggregating principal and interest on the
          loan and any refinancings of the loan.

               (b)  As of each Valuation Date, there shall be released from
          the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account maintained with respect to
          each Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1)
          Company Stock in an amount equal to (1) the number of shares
          which have a fair market value as of the Valuation Date equal to
          the amount of dividends paid to the Trust with respect to shares
          of Company Stock which were purchased with the proceeds of such
          loan or any loan refinanced with such loan (and Company Stock
          into which such purchased shares have been converted) and which
          have been allocated to Participants' Accounts, which dividends
          shall be received by the Trust since the immediately preceding
          Valuation Date, credited to Participants' Accounts and
          immediately placed in the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account to be
          used to repay the loan, reduced by (2) the number of any shares
          contributed or the number of shares purchased with any cash
          contributed to the Trust as Special Dividend Replacement
          Contributions in accordance with Section 4.2(e) with respect to
          the loan.<PAGE>

               (c)  Any release from the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account
          provided for in Section 6.3(b) for each Valuation Date during a
          Plan Year (including the last Valuation Date for a Plan Year)
          shall be made prior to the release from the Auxiliary ESOP
          Suspense Account provided for in Section 6.3(a).

         6.4   Installment Payments on Exempt Loan.

               (a)  Installment Payments.  The Trustee shall make payments
          on an Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1) in
          the amounts and at such times as such payments are due under the
          terms of such loan and such additional payments on such loan as
          the Trustee determines in its discretion, provided, however, such
          payments shall be made solely from the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense
          Account, from amounts of Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions
          made in cash, from dividends with respect to shares of Company
          Stock purchased with a loan or a loan refinanced by such loan (or
          Company Stock into which such shares have been converted) which
          shares have been released from an Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account
          and allocated to Participants' Accounts and from dividends or
          other earnings with respect to the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense
          Account maintained with respect to such loan and provided further
          that Per Capita Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions and related
          earnings shall be used solely to repay Per Capita Loans and
          Compensation Based Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions and
          related earnings shall be used solely to repay Compensation Based
          Loans.

               (b)  Sale of Company Stock Held in Auxiliary ESOP Suspense
          Account.  In the event that any shares of Company Stock acquired
          with the proceeds of a loan or a loan refinanced with such loan
          (and Company Stock into which such purchased shares have been
          converted) and held in an Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account are
          sold prior to release from such Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account,
          the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may either (1) apply the
          proceeds of such sale, or any portion thereof, toward repayment
          of such loan or a loan refinanced with such loan or (2) reinvest
          the proceeds of such sale, or any portion thereof, in shares of
          Company Stock.  In exercising its discretion pursuant to Section
          6.4(a), the Trustee shall consider the long-term interests of
          both current and future Participants and Beneficiaries in
          providing benefits under the Plan and Trust.

         6.5   Non-Terminable Rights and Protections.  Any of the
     provisions herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the following
     protections and rights are non-terminable, except to the extent
     required or permitted under applicable law, Treasury Regulations and
     Rulings of the Internal Revenue Service,  with respect to proceeds of
     an Exempt Loan regardless of whether the Plan continues to be
     maintained as a leveraged ESOP.

               (a)  Except as provided in this Section 6.5, or except as
          otherwise required by applicable law, no security acquired with
          the proceeds of an Exempt Loan may be subject to a put, call
          (other than a call with respect to Company Stock which is
          convertible preferred stock which provides for a reasonable
          opportunity for a conversion into common stock of the Company
          which is Company Stock after such call is exercised), or other
          option, or buy-sell or similar arrangement while held by and when<PAGE>


          distributed from the Plan, whether or not the Plan is then an
          ESOP.

               (b)  If any Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an
          Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1) or which
          is otherwise held in an Account in the McDESOP portion of the
          Plan is not readily tradeable on an established market, or
          thereafter ceases to be publicly traded and if and only if such
          Company Stock should ever be distributed from the Plan, the
          distributee shall be given an option exercisable only by the
          distributee (or the distributee's donees or a person, including
          an estate of a distributee, to whom the security passes by reason
          of the Participant's death), to put the security to the Company
          for a 60 day period beginning on the date of distribution ("First
          Put Period") and for another 60 day period commencing on the
          first anniversary of the date of distribution ("Second Put
          Period").  If such security ceases to be readily tradeable on an
          established market (or becomes subject to a trading limitation)
          before the end of the Second Put Period, the Company shall notify
          the Participant in writing on or before the 10th day after the
          date the security ceases to be readily tradeable on an
          established market (or becomes subject to a trading limitation)
          that the security is subject to a put option to the Company for
          any portion of the First Put Period and the Second Put Period
          remaining after the date the security ceases to be readily
          tradeable on an established market, and such notice shall inform
          the distributees of the terms of the put option.  The Plan shall
          have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the rights and
          obligations of the Company with respect to the put option at the
          time the put option is exercised.  A put option hereunder shall
          be exercised by the holder notifying the Company in writing that
          the put option is being exercised.  If during the First Put
          Period or the Second Put Period, a distributee is unable to
          exercise a put option because the Company is prohibited from
          honoring it under applicable Federal or State law ("Non-Exercise
          Period"), the put option shall be exercisable during an extended
          put period ("Extended Put Period").  The Extended Put Period
          shall commence on the 10th day after the Company can honor the
          put option and notice of this fact is given to the distributees
          entitled to an Extended Put Period and shall extend for a period
          equal to the number of days in the Non-Exercise Period but not
          more than 60 days.

               If the Non-Exercise Period was for more than 60 days, a
          second Extended Put Period shall occur commencing on the first
          anniversary of the first Extended Put Period and shall extend for
          the lesser of (1) 60 days or (2) number of days in the
          Non-Exercise Period reduced by 60 days.

               A put option shall be exercisable at a price equal to the

          Date following the Participant's exercise of the put option.
          Payment under a put option shall not be restricted by the
          provisions of a loan or other arrangement, including the
          Company's articles of incorporation, unless so required by State
          law.  If the distributee exercises a put option with respect to
          Company Stock received by the Participant as part of an
          installment distribution, the Company shall pay for such Company
          Stock not later than thirty days after the exercise of such
          option.  If the distributee exercises a put option with respect<PAGE>

          Participant within one taxable year of the balance to the credit
          of the Participant's vested Net Balance Account, the Company may
          pay for such Company Stock not later than the thirtieth day after
          the exercise of such option or may elect to pay for such Company
          Stock with deferred payments.  Payments for shares of Company
          Stock put to the Company may be deferred only if adequate
          security and a reasonable rate of interest are provided and if
          periodic payments are made in substantially equal installments
          (at least annually) beginning within 30 days after the date the
          put option is exercised and extending for no more than 5 years
          after the put option is exercised.

          The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or
     amended except to the extent required or permitted under applicable
     law, Treasury Regulations and Rulings of the Internal Revenue Service.

         6.6   Independent Appraisals Required.  All valuations of Company
     Stock which is not readily tradeable on an established securities
     market shall be made as of each Valuation Date by an independent
     appraiser meeting requirements similar to the requirements of the
     regulations prescribed under Section 170(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue
     Code.

         7.1   Profit Sharing Contribution Allocation Formula.

               (a)  As of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year, Profit
          Sharing Contribution Holding Fund #1 (after adjustment for
          earnings or losses of the Distribution Fund as provided in
          Section 10.18 and all contributions for the Plan Year which are
          made after the last day of the Plan Year as provided in
          Section 10.19) shall be allocated to the Profit Sharing Fund
          Account of each Active Participant who is a staff or an executive
          employee or a store manager, in an amount equal to the product of
          (1) multiplied by (2) where:

                    (1)  is Profit Sharing Contribution Holding Fund #1 for
               the Plan Year, and

                    (2)  is a fraction the numerator of which is the Active
               Participant's Considered Compensation for the Plan Year and
               the denominator of which is the total Considered
               Compensation of all such Active Participants for such Plan
               Year.

               (b)  As of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year, Profit
          Sharing Contribution Holding Fund #2 (after adjustment for
          earnings or losses of the Distribution Fund as provided in
          Section 10.18 and all Contributions for the Plan Year which are
          made after the last day of the Plan Year as provided in Section
          10.19) shall be allocated to the Profit Sharing Fund Account of
          each Active Participant who is a certified swing manager, a
          primary maintenance employee or crew or other store hourly
          employee in an amount equal to the product of (1) multiplied by
          (2) where:<PAGE>

                    (1)  is Profit Sharing Contribution Holding Fund #2 for
               the Plan Year, and

                    (2)  is a fraction of the numerator of which is the
               Active Participant's Considered Compensation for the Plan
               Year and the denominator of which is the total Considered
               Compensation of all such Active Participants for such Plan
               Year.

               (c)  Allocations to the Profit Sharing Fund Accounts of
          Active Participants shall be made as soon as reasonably possible
          after the end of a Plan Year after the Company has determined
          that its final contribution for the Plan Year has been made to
          the McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing Master
          Trust.  Employer Profit Sharing Contributions shall be held in
          the Profit Sharing Contribution Holding Fund until allocated to
          the Profit Sharing Fund Account of each Active Participant.  If
          notwithstanding its earlier determination that the final
          contribution for a Plan Year has been made, additional Employer
          Profit Sharing Contributions are contributed for a Plan Year,
          such contributions shall be allocated no later than the last day
          of the next following Plan Year.  Effective the first day of the
          calendar month next following the date amounts are allocated
          pursuant to this Section 7.1, such amounts shall be invested in
          accordance with the investment elections applicable to each
          respective Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account as provided
          in Sections 10.7, 10.8 or 10.11.

          Forfeitures (excluding Employer Per Capita Matching
          Contributions) held in the Employer Matching Contribution Holding
          Fund shall be allocated to the Employer Matching Contribution
          Account of each Active Participant in an equal percentage (not to
          exceed the Matching Percentage as defined in Section 4.1(a)) of
          each Participant's Participant Elected Matched Contributions
          (excluding Special Participant Elected Matched Contributions)
          made for the period since the immediately preceding Valuation
          Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount in the Employer
          Matching Contribution Holding Fund as of the last Valuation Date
          of the Plan Year (even if such contributions for the Plan Year
          are made after such Valuation Date as provided in Section 10.18)
          after allocations are made pursuant to the preceding sentence,
          shall be allocated to Employer Matching Contribution Account of
          each Active Participant who is an Employee on such Valuation Date
          in an amount equal to such remaining amount multiplied by a
          fraction the numerator of which is the amount of Participant
          Elected Matched Contributions (excluding Special Participant
          Elected Matched Contributions) made on behalf of such Active
          Participant for the Plan Year and the denominator of which is the
          total amount of Participant Elected Matched Contributions
          (excluding Special Participant Elected Matched Contributions)
          made on behalf of all such Active Participants for the Plan Year.

          Valuation Date of the Plan Year, in an equal amount to the
          Employer Matching Contribution Account of each designated Active
          Participant.  The designated Active Participants shall be the
          smallest group of Non-Highly Compensated Employees who made
          Participant Elected Contributions for the Plan Year and to whom
          the dollar amount of per individual Special Section 401(k)
          Employer Contributions could be allocated which would cause the
          Plan to pass whichever of the following tests it would not
          otherwise pass:  the ADP test in Section 5.2(e), the ACP test in
          Section 4.1(c) or the multiple use test in Section 5.4.

               (c)  Allocation of Additional Employer Contributions.  As of
          the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year as the Board of
          Directors may direct, Additional Employer Contributions shall be
          allocated to the Employer Matching Contribution Account of each
          Active Participant in an amount equal to the amount of the
          Additional Employer Contributions for the Plan Year multiplied by
          a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar
          months during which the Participant was an Active Participant,
          and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of full
          calendar months during which all Active Participants were Active
          Participants.

               (d)  Allocation of Employer Per Capita Matching

          to specified Employer Per Capita Matching Contributions, the
          Employer Per Capita Matching Contributions held in the Employer
          Per Capita Matching Contribution Holding Fund (even if such
          contributions for the Plan Year are made after such Valuation
          Date as provided in Section 7.5) shall be allocated to the
          Employer Matching Contribution Account of each Active Participant
          for a Plan Year or portion of a Plan Year in an amount equal to
          the Employer Per Capita Matching Contributions divided by the
          number of Active Participants eligible to receive Employer Per
          Capita Matching Contributions for the Plan Year or portion of a
          Plan Year.

     Participant in the Plan solely for the limited purpose of making a<PAGE>
     Rollover Contribution subject to the same conditions on such Rollover
     Contributions as any other Participant.

               McDESOP portion of the Plan, and if no more than one-third
               (1/3) of the total amounts deductible under Section
               404(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code for the Plan Year is
               allocated to Highly Compensated Employees, an amount for
               each Exempt Loan equal to the product of (A) the Employer
               Auxiliary ESOP Contributions used to repay each loan for the
               Plan Year, and reduced, for any Plan Year for which the loan
               repaid is an Exempt Loan as defined in Section 6.1, by the
               amount used to pay interest on the Exempt Loan, multiplied
               by (B) (i) in the case of Per Capita Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contributions, a fraction, the numerator of which is one,
               and the denominator of which is the number of Active
               Participants and (ii) in the case of Compensation Based
               Auxiliary ESOP Contributions, a fraction, the numerator of
               which is the Participant's Considered Compensation for the
               Plan Year, and the denominator of which is the Considered
               Compensation of all Active Participants for the Plan Year;
               provided that, if a Participant's allocations to his
               Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account are reduced in
               order to reduce the Annual Excess in accordance with the
               provisions of this Article IX, the Participant's Considered
               Compensation for purposes of both the numerator and the
               denominator of this fraction shall be reduced to an amount
               equal to the Participant's Considered Compensation,
               multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
               Participant's allocation to his Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contribution Account for the Plan Year after applying the
               Annual Excess reduction provisions hereunder and the
               denominator of which is such allocation to his Employer
               Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account for the Plan Year before
               applying the Annual Excess reduction provisions hereunder.

                    (2)  If the Participant is an Active Participant with
               respect to the ESOP for the Plan Year and if
               Section 9.1(c)(1) does not apply, an amount for each loan
               equal to the sum of (A) Forfeitures allocated to the<PAGE>
               Participant's Per Capita Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contribution Account and Compensation Based Employer
               Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account under the McDESOP
               portion of the Plan, and (B) the sum of the products of the
               Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions used to repay each
               loan for the Plan Year (including the amount used to repay
               interest on such loans), multiplied by (i)(a) in the case of
               Per Capita Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions, a
               fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator
               of which is the number of Active Participants and (b) in the
               case of Compensation Based Auxiliary ESOP Contributions, a
               fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant's
               Considered Compensation for the Plan Year and the
               denominator of which is the Considered Compensation of all
               Active Participants for the Plan Year; provided that, if a
               Participant's allocations to his Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contribution Account are reduced in order to reduce the
               Annual Excess in accordance with the provisions of this
               Article IX, the Participant's Considered Compensation for
               purposes of both the numerator and the denominator of this
               fraction shall be reduced to an amount equal to the
               Participant's Considered Compensation, multiplied by a
               fraction, the numerator of which is the Participant's
               allocation to his Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution
               Account for the Plan Year, after applying the Annual Excess
               reduction provisions hereunder and the denominator of which
               is such allocation to his Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contribution Account for the Plan Year before applying the
               Annual Excess reduction provisions hereunder.

                    (3)  The amount of Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Contributions deemed to be used to pay interest on a loan
               for a Plan Year for purposes of Section 9.1(c)(2)(A) and (B)
               shall be the amount of Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions
               made for the Plan Year multiplied by a fraction the
               numerator of which is the amount of all interest payments
               made by the Trust for the Plan Year with respect to such
               loan (including any refinancing of such loan) from all
               sources and the denominator of which is the amount of all
               payments of both principal and interest made by the Trust
               for the Plan Year with respect to such loan (including any
               refinancing of such loan) from all sources.

               (d)  Elimination of Annual Excess.  If a Participant has an
          Annual Excess for a Plan Year, such excess shall not be allocated
          to the Participant's Accounts, but shall be eliminated as
          follows:

                    (1)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's Employer
               Contributions allocable to such Participant's Profit Sharing
               Fund Account shall be reduced to the extent such reductions
               reduce the Annual Excess.

                    (2)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's Leveraged ESOP
               Annual Additions (other than those with respect to Dividend
               Replacement Contributions) shall be reduced by reducing the
               allocations made as of a given Valuation Date reducing
               allocations with respect to Forfeitures before allocations<PAGE>
               with respect to Employer Contributions for each loan
               starting first with the most recent loan and then with other
               loans in the reverse of the order in which made to the
               extent which reductions reduce the amount of the Annual
               Excess.

                    (3)  For Plan Years ending before July 1, 1993, if any
               Annual Excess remains after application of the preceding
               paragraph, Participant Elected Contributions, Employer
               Matching Contributions, Special Section 401(k) Employer
               Contributions and Forfeitures shall be reduced by reducing
               those contributions most recently credited to the
               Participant's Accounts first (followed by the next most
               recent and so forth) and with respect to contributions
               credited as of a Valuation Date, reducing allocations in the
               order indicated below:

                    (A)  The Participant's allocations of Participant
                    Elected Unmatched Contributions and any Special Section
                    401(k) Employer Contributions allocated with respect
                    thereto shall be reduced, in proportionate amounts, to
                    the extent such reductions reduce the amount of the
                    Annual Excess.

                    (B)  The Participant's allocations of Participant
                    Elected Matched Contributions and the Employer Matching
                    Contributions, Special Section 401(k) Employer
                    Contributions and Forfeitures allocated with respect
                    thereto shall be reduced, in proportionate amounts, to
                    the extent such reductions reduce the amount of the
                    Annual Excess.  Participant Elected Matched
                    Contributions (except for Special Participant Elected
                    Matched Contributions) which are matched by Employer
                    Matching Contributions at the lowest rate shall be
                    reduced first followed by those matched at higher rates
                    in sequence and followed lastly by Special Participant
                    Elected Matched Contributions.

               to the extent such reductions reduce the amount of the
               Annual Excess.

                    (4)  For Plan Year ending on or after July 1, 1993, if
               any Annual Excess remains after application of the preceding
               paragraph, Participant Elected Contributions and Employer
               Matching Contributions shall be reduced by reducing those
               contributions most recently credited to the Participant's
               Accounts first (followed by the next most recent and so
               forth) and with respect to contributions credited as of a
               Valuation Date reducing contributions in the order listed,
               as follows:  Employer Matching Contributions, Participant
               Elected Unmatched Contributions and Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions to the extent such reductions reduce
               the amount of the Annual Excess.

                    (5)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's allocations of
               Additional Employer Contributions shall be reduced to the
               extent such reductions reduce the amount of the Annual
               Excess.<PAGE>

                    (6)  For Plan Years ending on or after July 1, 1993, if
               any Annual Excess remains after application of the preceding
               paragraph, the Participant's allocations of Special Section
               401(k) Employer Contributions shall be reduced to the extent
               such reductions reduce the amount of the remaining Annual
               Excess.

                    (7)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's allocations to
               his Additional Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account
               shall be reduced to the extent such reductions reduce the
               amount of the Annual Excess.

                    (8)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, any Special Dividend Replacement
               Contributions credited to the Participant's Employer
               Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account shall be reduced to the
               extent such reductions reduce the amount of the remaining
               Annual Excess.

          Any allocations of Employer Contributions and Forfeitures reduced
          or eliminated under this Section 9.1(d), as above provided,
          shall, subject to the limits of this Section 9.1, be reallocated
          to the Accounts of the other Participants not having such
          reductions as of the last day of that Plan Year in the same
          manner as such Employer Contributions and Forfeitures were
          initially allocated under Article VII.  The amount of any
          Participant Elected Contributions reduced or eliminated under
          this Section 9.1 which have been contributed to the Plan shall be
          allocated as (and in lieu of) Employer Matching Contributions in
          the Plan Year for which or next following the Plan Year for which
          the reduction is made.  Any Employer Contributions and
          Forfeitures which, under the limits of this Section 9.1, cannot
          be reallocated to the Accounts of other Participants in the Plan
          Year shall, subject to the limits of this Section 9.1, be held in
          an unallocated suspense account and reallocated in a subsequent
          Plan Year.  If the Plan shall be terminated, any amounts held in
          a suspense account shall be reallocated to the accounts of all
          Participants in accordance with Article VII subject to the
          limitations of Section 9.1, and any such amounts which cannot be
          reallocated to Participants in the Plan Year of the termination
          shall be returned to the Employers in such proportions as shall
          be determined by the Committee.

               (e)  Limitation in Case of Employee Participation in Both
          Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans.  If a Participant
          participates in any defined benefit plan of the Employer (or any
          Related Defined Benefit Plan), the sum of the Defined Benefit
          Plan Fraction (as defined in Section 415(e)(2) of the Internal
          Revenue Code) and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction (as
          defined in Section 415(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) for
          such Participant shall not exceed 1.0 (called the "Combined
          Fraction").  If the Combined Fraction of such Participant exceeds
          1.0, the Participant's Defined Benefit Plan Fraction shall be
          reduced by limiting the Participant's annual benefits payable
          from the Related Defined Benefit Plan in which he participates to
          the extent necessary to reduce the Combined Fraction of such
          Participant to 1.0, and to the extent the Combined Fraction
          continues to exceed 1.0, by reducing the Participant's Maximum
          Annual Additions to the extent necessary to reduce the Combined<PAGE>
          Fraction to 1.0.  In calculating the Participant's Defined
          Contribution Fraction employee contributions as permitted under
          the Plan or a Related Plan before January 1, 1987, shall be
          counted as Annual Additions only to the extent that they were
          counted under the Plan as then in effect.

         9.2   Employer Contribution Reductions.  If a Participant's
     Participant Elected Contributions or his allocations of Employer
     Contributions and Forfeitures are reduced or eliminated under
     Section 9.1, the amount shall be provided to the Participant under
     McEqual, McCAP I or McCAP II, or other non-qualified plans maintained
     by the Company, to the extent therein provided.  Amounts of
     Participant Elected Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions
     expected to be within the limitations under Section 9.1 shall be
     contributed to the Plan and credited hereunder.  Amounts of such
     contributions expected to be in excess of the limitations under
     Section 9.1 shall be tentatively credited to McEqual, McCAP I or
     McCAP II or other non-qualified plans maintained by the Company.  If
     it is subsequently determined that additional amounts of Participant
     Elected Contributions or Employer Matching Contributions should be
     contributed hereto to attain the limitations under Section 9.1, in
     order to put the Participant in the same position he would have been
     in had such amounts been contributed contemporaneously to the Plan,
     contributions to the Plan will reflect, to the extent of the limits of
     Section 9.1, the income, gains and losses which would have been
     credited to the Participant's Accounts hereunder had such amounts been
     credited hereto instead of being tentatively credited to McEqual,
     McCAP I, McCAP II or other non-qualified plans maintained by the
     Company.  The effect of adjustments to contributions for such income,
     gains and losses may be that some Participants hereunder will be
     credited with Participant Elected Contributions in excess of the
     limits stated in Sections 4.3(a) and 5.1 and in amounts which are more
     than or less than the amounts of such contributions elected by the
     Participant, and may have rates of Employer Matching Contributions
     which are larger or smaller than the rate established by the Company
     for the Plan Year in accordance with Section 4.1.  In determining the
     amounts to be credited to a Participant's accounts during a Plan Year
     under McEqual, McCAP I, McCAP II and other non-qualified plans
     maintained by the Company, the Committee may make assumptions based
     upon reasonable estimates of the amount of the Participant's
     Considered Compensation, his Participant Elected Contributions, levels
     of Employer Contributions hereunder and other relevant factors and, as
     necessary, make subsequent adjustments to the extent the estimates
     prove to be incorrect.

                            TRUSTEE AND TRUST FUNDS

        10.1   Trust Agreements.  The Company and the Trustee have entered
     into one or more Trust Agreements which provide for the investment of
     the assets of the Plan and administration of the Trust Funds.  The
     Trust Agreement, as from time to time amended, shall continue in force
     and shall be deemed to form a part of the Plan, and any and all rights
     or benefits which may accrue to any person under the Plan shall be
     subject to all the terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.

        10.2   Trustee's Duties.  The powers, duties and responsibilities
     of the Trustee of the Trust shall be as stated in the respective Trust<PAGE>
     Agreement and as may be delegated to, and accepted by, the Trustee
     from the Committee and Board of Directors.  Nothing contained in the
     Plan either expressly or by implication shall be deemed to impose any
     additional powers, duties or responsibilities upon the Trustee.  All
     Employer Contributions, Participant Contributions, Rollover
     Contributions and Participant Elected Contributions shall be paid into
     a Trust and all withdrawals permitted and benefits payable under the
     Plan shall be paid from the Trust.

        10.3   Trust Expenses.  Except to the extent paid by an Employer,
     all clerical, legal and other expenses of the Plan and the Trust and
     the Trustee's fees shall be paid by the Trust and shall be
     proportionately charged to the Auxiliary ESOP and other parts of the
     Trust Fund except to the extent directly attributable to a specific
     portion of a Trust Fund in which case it shall be charged to that
     portion of the Trust Fund.

        10.4   Trust Entity.  The Trust under this Plan from its inception
     shall be a separate entity aside and apart from the Employers or their
     assets.  The Trusts and the corpus and income thereof, shall not be
     subject to the rights or claims of any creditor of any Employer.

        10.5   Right of the Employers to Trust Assets.  Subject to the
     provisions of Section 9.1, the Employers shall have no right or claims
     of any nature in or to the Trust Fund except the right to require the
     Trustee to hold, use, apply, and pay such assets in its possession in
     accordance with the Plan for the exclusive benefit of the Participants
     or their Beneficiaries and for defraying the reasonable expenses of
     administering the Plan and Trust, provided that:

               (a)  if, and to the extent that, a deduction for Employer
          contributions under Section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code is
          disallowed, employer contributions conditioned on deductibility
          shall be returned to the appropriate Employer within one year
          after the disallowance of the deduction; and

               (b)  if, and to the extent that, an Employer contribution is
          made through mistake of fact, such employer contribution shall be
          returned to the appropriate Employer within one year of the
          payment of the contribution and any Participant Elected
          Contributions shall be distributed to the Participants with
          respect to which such contributions were made.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10.5, if,
     upon application of (a) or (b) above, Employer contributions would be
     returned to an Employer, then the Employer shall distribute the value
     of any portion of such contributions to the appropriate Participants.

          All Employer Contributions are conditioned on their being
     deductible under Section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.

        10.6   Trust Investment Funds.  Excluding those assets held in the
     Distribution Fund, as provided in Section 10.27, assets of the Trust
     Fund shall be held as follows:

               (a)  Profit Sharing Plan.  The assets of the Profit Sharing
          Plan portion of the Trust and any amounts transferred to a
          Qualified Participant's Diversification Account pursuant to
          Sections 10.6(c) and 10.12 shall be held in the following
          Investment Funds:<PAGE>

                    (1)  The Diversified Stock Fund invested in common
               stocks, and securities convertible into common stocks, of
               corporations other than McDonald's Corporation or its
               Domestic or Foreign Affiliates, and in any other securities
               which represent an equity investment, provided, however,
               that the Diversified Stock Fund may be invested in pooled or
               common trust funds or open-end investment companies without
               regard to whether assets of such funds or investment
               companies are invested in securities of McDonald's
               Corporation or its Domestic or Foreign Affiliates;

                    (2)  The Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund
               invested in common stock of McDonald's Corporation;

                    (3)  The Insurance Contract Fund or such other fund

                         (i)  Effective prior to November 1, 1993, solely
                    in such contracts issued by such insurance company (or
                    companies) as may be from time to time selected by the
                    Committee, which may include (but shall not be limited
                    to) a group annuity contract, a guaranteed investment
                    contract, an immediate participation guaranty contract,
                    or a deposit administration contract.  Such insurance
                    company as of date of selection, must have an A plus
                    rating by A.M. Best Company or a comparable rating by a
                    comparable service which rates insurance companies.
                    The Committee shall have the right directly, or
                    indirectly through directing the Trustee, to exercise
                    all rights, powers and elections provided under any
                    such contract.

                         (ii) Effective November 1, 1993 and thereafter,
                    (A) in contracts issued by an insurance or other
                    company (or companies), (B) directly in debt securities
                    that have fixed obligations to pay interest and
                    principal on specified dates or which have similar
                    investment characteristics (which may have equity
                    features triggered by performance, the passage of time,
                    or similar characteristics or may be securities which
                    are derivatives of such securities) ("Fixed Income
                    Obligations") or (C) in pooled or common trust funds,
                    regulated investment companies, or open-ended
                    investment companies generally invested in Fixed Income
                    Obligations without regard to whether assets of such
                    common trust funds, regulated investment companies, or
                    open-ended investment companies are invested in
                    securities of McDonald's Corporation or its Domestic or
                    Foreign Affiliates.  The contracts issued by insurance
                    or other companies held by the Insurance Contract Fund
                    (X) may be investment contracts or (Y) may be
                    investment management agreements which may provide
                    separate book value guarantees pursuant to which the
                    insurance or other company guarantees (i) the book
                    value of a pool or segregated group of fixed income
                    obligations held in the Insurance Contract Fund and
                    (ii) specified amounts of income under various
                    conditions as provided in such agreement ((X) and (Y)
                    collectively shall be referred to as "Assets Subject to<PAGE>
                    Guarantee").  With respect to Assets Subject to
                    Guarantee, the Plan shall use book value accounting and
                    Participants' Accounts shall contain and shall be
                    entitled only to their pro rata share of book value and
                    guaranteed income which for all purposes hereunder will
                    be treated as fair market value unless the Committee
                    determines that the guarantees no longer apply, a
                    market value distribution has occurred under the
                    contract, or there has been a default on the guarantee.

                    (4)  The Multi-Asset Fund invested in domestic common
               stocks, debt securities that have a fixed obligation to pay
               interest and principal on specified dates or which have
               substantially similar investment characteristics, real
               estate, international common stocks, and securities
               convertible into domestic common stocks, of corporations
               other than McDonald's Corporation or its Domestic or Foreign
               Affiliates, and in any other securities which represent an
               equity investment, provided, however, that the Multi-Asset
               Fund may be invested in pooled or common trust funds or
               open-end investment companies without regard to whether
               assets of such funds or investment companies are invested in
               securities of McDonald's Corporation or its Domestic or
               Foreign Affiliates; and

                    (5)  The Money Market Fund invested in United States
               Government debt securities which mature or become payable
               within two years and which are the direct obligation of or
               guaranteed by the United States Government, including bonds,
               notes, certificates of indebtedness, and treasury bills; in
               commercial paper rated A-l and P-l by Moody's and Standard &
               Poor's; and in certificates of deposit in those banks
               designated in the agreement with the Investment Manager or,
               if there is no such agreement or if the agreement fails to
               designate such banks, in the McDonald's Corporation
               Investment Policy.

                    In addition to investments otherwise permitted for the
               Money Market Fund, funds which otherwise could not be
               appropriately invested either because of the small amount
               involved, or because of the short time duration for which an
               investment is to be made, may be invested in the Northern
               Trust Company Collective Trust Short Term Investment Fund
               and such other common or collective trust funds or
               investment companies registered under the Investment Company
               Act of 1940, which have similar investment and
               administrative characteristics, as the Committee may from
               time to time designate.  The portion of a Trust Sub-fund
               invested in the Money Market Fund may be held in a separate
               Subaccount within the Money Market Fund or may be aggregated
               into Subaccounts for several Trust Sub-funds as the Plan
               Administrator shall determine.  The portion of the Profit
               Sharing Contribution Holding Fund and the portion of the
               Rollover Contribution Holding Fund invested in the Money
               Market Fund shall each be invested in separate Trust
               Subaccounts which may be invested in identified accounts in
               a common or collective trust fund or investment company fund
               or may hold identified assets and shall be directly credited
               with the income of such separate Trust Subaccount or
               identified assets.<PAGE>

               In order to maintain appropriate or adequate liquidity and
          pending or pursuant to investment directions from an Investment
          Manager, the Trustee of the Trust is authorized to hold such
          portions as it deems necessary of the Diversified Stock Fund, the
          Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund, and the Multi-Asset
          Fund in cash or liquid short-term cash equivalent investments or
          securities (including, but not limited to United States
          government treasury bills, commercial paper, and savings accounts
          and certificates of deposit, including those of the Trustee, and
          common or commingled trust funds invested in such securities,
          including those of the Trustee).

               (b)  McDESOP.  The assets of the McDESOP portion of the
          Trust (other than any amounts which have been transferred to a
          Participant's Diversification Account pursuant to Section 10.12)
          shall be held in the following Investment Funds:

                    (1)  The McDESOP McDonald's Common Stock Fund invested
               in Company Stock which is common stock of McDonald's
               Corporation, and

                    (2)  The McDESOP McDonald's Preferred Stock Fund
               invested in Company Stock which is non-callable preferred
               stock of McDonald's Corporation which is convertible at any
               time into common stock of McDonald's Corporation or is
               callable preferred stock which provides a reasonable
               opportunity for conversion into McDonald's common stock
               after it is called;

          provided that any shares of Company Stock held in the McDESOP
          McDonald's Common Stock Fund and McDESOP McDonald's Preferred
          Stock Fund shall be separately allocated to Participant's
          Participant Elected Contribution Accounts, Employer Matching
          Contribution Accounts and Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution
          Accounts which shall be denominated in shares of Company Stock.

               In order to maintain adequate liquidity, pending the
          investment of funds in one of the aforementioned Investment
          Funds, pending the use of funds to make payments on a loan or for
          funds which could not be appropriately invested either because of
          the small amount involved or the short time duration for which
          the investment is to be made, the Trustee is authorized to hold
          such portions of the Trust Fund in the Northern Trust Company
          Collective Trust Short Term Investment Fund and such other common
          or collective trust funds or investment companies registered
          under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which have similar
          investment and administrative characteristics, as the Committee
          may from time to time designate.  The portion of a Trust Sub-fund
          so invested shall be held in a separate identified Sub-account in
          such short term fund and shall be directly credited with the
          income of such separate Trust Sub-account.  The McDESOP
          McDonald's Common Stock Fund and the McDESOP McDonald's Preferred
          Stock Fund may hold identified assets and shall be directly
          credited with the income of such identified assets.

               (c)  McDESOP Diversification Fund.  Participant Elected
          Contributions which a Participant has elected to diversify
          pursuant to Section 10.12 shall be credited to the Participant's
          McDESOP Contribution Diversification Account and invested in the<PAGE>
          Profit Sharing Plan Trust Investment Funds listed in Section
          10.6(a) as provided in Section 10.12 as of the first business day
          of the calendar month following the month in which (1) the
          diversification election was made for amounts diversified in
          accordance with Sections 10.8, 10.12 and 10.13 and (2) the
          compensation (from which such Participant Elected Contributions
          were taken) was paid or as of such earlier date as the Committee
          shall provide.  Until such date as the Committee shall provide
          otherwise, Participant Elected Contributions and Employer
          Matching Contributions which the Participant has elected to
          diversify pursuant to Section 10.12 shall be invested in the
          McDESOP McDonald's Common Stock Fund until the Diversification
          Election is implemented pursuant to Section 10.13.  In the case
          of future contributions subject to a Diversification Election
          pursuant to Section 10.12, the Diversification Election shall be
          implemented as of the next date on which Investment Elections are
          implemented in accordance with Section 10.8 or 10.11(a), as
          applicable, after the date such contributions are made to the
          Plan.

        10.7   Investment of Participant's Employer Profit Sharing
     Contributions.  The provisions of Sections 10.7(a) and 10.7(b) shall
     apply to Employer Profit Sharing Contributions as follows:

               (a)  Each Participant's share of Employer Profit Sharing
          Contributions and the earnings thereon shall be invested in the
          Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund in an amount equal to
          the Participant's share of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions
          multiplied by the Automatic McDonald's Stock Proportion.  The
          remainder of the Participant's Employer Profit Sharing
          Contributions and the earnings thereon for the Plan Year shall be
          invested in accordance with Section 10.8 or 10.11, as applicable;
          provided that if in accordance with a Participant's elections
          pursuant to Section 10.8, a percentage of his Employer Profit
          Sharing Contributions and the earnings thereon for the Plan Year
          greater than the Automatic McDonald's Stock Proportion would be
          invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund, the
          Participant's Employer Profit Sharing Contributions and the
          earnings thereon with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan for the
          Plan Year shall be invested in accordance with the Participant's
          elections pursuant to Section 10.8.  The "Automatic McDonald's
          Stock Proportion" is a percentage announced by the Board of
          Directors for the Plan Year.

               (b)  A Participant may elect, at such time and in such
          manner as the Committee shall designate for each Plan Year not to
          have the Automatic McDonald's Stock Proportion of his Employer
          Profit Sharing Contributions and Forfeitures and the earnings
          thereon with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan for the Plan Year
          invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund.  If
          a Participant elects not to have the Automatic McDonald's Stock
          Proportion of his Employer Profit Sharing Contributions and
          Forfeitures with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan for the Plan
          Year invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund,
          his Employer Profit Sharing Contributions, such Forfeitures and
          the earnings thereon shall be invested in accordance with
          Sections 10.8 or 10.11, as applicable.

        10.8   Investment Election with Regard to a Participant's Profit
     Sharing Fund Account and Diversification Accounts.  Four times each<PAGE>
     Plan Year (three times each Plan Year prior to July 1, 1993) (or on
     such more frequent basis as the Committee shall permit), each

     accordance with such rules and procedures as the Committee may from
     time to time prescribe, to have his Profit Sharing Fund Account
     (including any amounts which have previously been invested in the

     and his Diversification Accounts, if any, invested in the Diversified
     Stock Fund, the Money Market Fund, the Profit Sharing McDonald's
     Common Stock Fund, the Insurance Contract Fund, the Multi-Asset Fund
     or other similar fund designated by the Committee or in any
     combination of them; provided that amounts which have been invested in
     the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund in accordance with
     Section 10.7 shall remain invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's
     Common Stock Fund until a new investment election made by the
     Participant in accordance with this Section 10.8 is effective.

     If a Participant makes a LESOP Diversification Election, a Future
     Contribution Diversification Election or McDESOP Diversification
     Election in accordance with Section 10.12, his Diversification
     Account, if any, shall be invested in accordance with his Profit
     Sharing Fund Account investment election in effect at the time his
     diversification election is effective or in accordance with
     Section 10.11(a) if no such investment election is in effect and shall
     be invested in accordance with any subsequently effective Investment
     Election as provided above.  The Participant's election as to the
     percentage of his Profit Sharing Fund Account and Diversification
     Account to be invested in each Investment Fund, shall be made in
     increments of 10 percent (10%) up to 100 percent (100%).  A
     Participant may elect to invest as much as 100% of his Profit Sharing
     Fund Account and Diversification Account in the Profit Sharing
     McDonald's Common Stock Fund.  Subject to Section 10.7, a
     Participant's investment election shall be effective until his next
     investment election is effective.

        10.9   Investment Election with Regard to a Participant's
     Investment Savings Fund Account.  Four times each Plan Year (three
     times each Plan Year prior to July 1, 1993) (or on such more frequent
     basis as the Committee shall permit), each Participant who elected to
     make Participant Contributions, shall have the right to elect, on such
     forms and in accordance with such rules and procedures as the
     Committee may from time to time prescribe, to have his Investment
     Savings Fund Account invested in the Diversified Stock Fund, the Money
     Market Fund, the Insurance Contract Fund or the Multi-Asset Fund (or
     other similar fund designated by the Committee) or in any combination
     of them.  The Participant's investment election under this Section

     (100%).  A Participant's investment election shall be effective until
     his next investment election.

        10.10  Investment Election with Regard to a Participant's Rollover
     Contribution Account.  Four times each Plan Year (three times each
     Plan Year prior to July 1, 1993) (or on such more frequent basis as
     the Committee shall permit), each Participant shall have the right to
     elect, on such forms and in accordance with such rules and procedures
     as the Committee may from time to time prescribe, to have his Rollover
     Contribution Account invested in the Insurance Contract Fund (or other
     similar fund designated by the Committee), the Diversified Stock Fund,
     the Money Market Fund or the Multi-Asset Fund or in any combination of<PAGE>
     them.  The Participant's investment election under this Section shall
     be made in increments of ten percent (l0%) up to 100 percent (100%).

        10.11  Failure to Make an Investment Election.

               (a)  Profit Sharing Fund Accounts.  If a Participant fails
          to make an investment election for his Profit Sharing Fund
          Account and his Diversification Account during any Plan Year,
          then such Accounts shall be invested in accordance with such
          Participant's immediately preceding investment election made with
          respect to such Accounts in accordance with Section 10.8;
          provided that any amounts invested in the Profit Sharing
          McDonald's Common Stock Fund in accordance with Section 10.7
          shall remain invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common
          Stock Fund until a new investment election made by the
          Participant in accordance with Section 10.8 is effective.  If a
          Participant has never made an investment election with respect to
          such Accounts, then the amount, if any, invested in the Profit
          Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund in accordance with
          Section 10.7 shall remain invested in the Profit Sharing
          McDonald's Common Stock Fund and the remainder of the

          LESOP Diversification Account and the McDESOP Contribution

          (100%) in the Money Market Fund.

               (b)  Investment Savings Fund Account and Rollover

          and/or his Rollover Contribution Account during any Plan Year,
          then such Account(s) shall be invested in accordance with such
          Participant's immediately preceding investment election made with
          respect to such Account(s).  If a Participant has never made an
          investment election with respect to such Account(s) then such
          Account(s) shall be invested 100 percent (100%) in the Money
          Market Fund.

                    a LESOP diversification election.

                         (B)  Effective before July 1, 1994, a Qualified

                         Sharing Plan Accounts (the latter considering only
                         the portion of the balance attributable to the
                         Company Stock acquired by the McDonald's Stock
                         Sharing Plan after December 31, 1986).

                         (E)  "LESOP Diversification Election" means an
                    election by a Qualified Participant to transfer to his
                    LESOP Diversification Account or McDESOP
                    Diversification Account, as applicable, an amount not
                    exceeding the difference between

                              (i)  the Maximum Diversification Percentage
                         (or lesser percentages in five percent (5%)<PAGE>
                         increments) of the sum of (a) the value of Company
                         Stock credited to the Participant's Qualified
                         Account plus (b) the amounts previously
                         transferred under this Section 10.12 from such
                         Qualified Account to the Participant's
                         Diversification Accounts ("Prior Diversification
                         Transfers"), reduced by

                              (ii) the Participant's Prior Diversification
                         Transfers.

                              If a Participant has made a LESOP
                         Diversification Election and has not made a
                         subsequent LESOP Diversification Election with a
                         lower percentage election than his prior LESOP
                         Diversification Election, a percentage of the
                         value of all future allocations to the
                         Participant's Qualified Account equal to the
                         percentage of the Participant's LESOP
                         Diversification Election shall be transferred to
                         the Participant's LESOP Diversification Account.
                         If a Participant who has made a LESOP
                         Diversification Election makes a new LESOP
                         Diversification Election at a percentage
                         (including to zero) lower than the percentage of
                         the earlier LESOP Diversification Election, no
                         portion of allocations to the Participant's
                         Qualified Account shall be transferred to the
                         Diversification Account until the product of the
                         new lower percentage elected multiplied by the sum
                         of the Qualified Account plus Prior
                         Diversification Transfers exceeds the Prior
                         Diversification Transfers, at which time such
                         excess, and thereafter, a percentage of all future
                         allocations to the Participant's Qualified Account
                         equal to the percentage of the Participant's LESOP
                         Diversification Election shall be transferred to
                         Participant's Diversification Account.  No amount
                         transferred to a Participant's Diversification
                         Account may be transferred back to the
                         Participant's Employer Auxiliary ESOP Account.

                    (3)  Investment of Amounts Subject to LESOP
               Diversification Election.  The amount subject to a
               Participant's LESOP Diversification Election shall be
               transferred to the Participant's LESOP Diversification
               Account or McDESOP Diversification Account under the Plan
               and thereafter shall be invested in accordance with the
               Participant's elections pursuant to Section 10.8 or 10.11(a)
               but determined without regard to Section 10.7 provided that
               such transfer shall occur no later than 90 days after the
               date on which the Participant becomes a Qualified
               Participant, attains age 60 or the end of each Annual
               Election Period during which the Participant makes a LESOP
               Diversification Election or at such earlier dates as the
               Committee, pursuant to Section 10.13 shall permit.

               (b)  Diversification of Future Contributions Participant
          Elected Contributions.  Effective on or after July 1, 1993, if
          the balance of a Participant's Participant Elected Contribution<PAGE>
          Account is equal to $1500 or more (or such lesser amount as the
          Committee from time to time determines), the Participant may make
          an election ("Future Contribution Diversification Election") with
          respect to his future Participant Elected Contributions to have
          up to 100 percent of the amount of such contributions, in
          increments of 25 percent, credited to his McDESOP Diversification
          Account.  Once he has made a Future Contribution Diversification
          Election, a Participant may change his election with respect to
          future Participant Elected Contributions, subject to
          Section 10.13, but each such change shall only effect Participant
          Elected Contributions made to the Plan after the date the
          election is effective and before the date a new Future
          Contribution Diversification Election becomes effective.
          Effective July 1, 1994, Future Contribution Diversification
          Elections may be made by any Participant regardless of the size
          of his account balance and may be made in five percent (5%)
          increments.

               (c)  Age Diversification of Participant Elected Contribution
          Accounts and Employer Matching Contribution Accounts.  Effective
          July 1, 1994, beginning with the first day of the month following
          the month in which a Participant attains 50 years of age, the
          Participant (or the Beneficiary of a Participant who would have
          attained age 50 if he had not died) may elect to diversify by
          transferring to his McDESOP Diversification Account up to 100
          percent (100%) (in increments of five percent (5%)) of his:

                    (1)  Participant Elected Contribution Account; and

                    (2)  Employer Matching Contribution Accounts.

               The diversification amount to be transferred from a
          Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account shall be
          an amount equal to the difference between (A) the diversification
          percentage elected by the Participant multiplied by the sum of
          (i) the Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account,
          and (ii) the amounts previously transferred from the
          Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account to the
          Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account ("Prior Elected
          Contribution Transfers") reduced by (B) the amount of the
          Participant's Prior Elected Contribution Transfers.  The
          Diversification Amount to be transferred from a Participant's
          Employer Matching Contribution Accounts shall be an amount equal
          to the difference between (A) the diversification percentage
          elected by the Participant multiplied by the sum of (i) the
          Participant's Employer Matching Contribution Accounts and
          (ii) the amounts previously transferred from the Participant's
          Employer Matching Contribution Accounts to the Participant's
          McDESOP Diversification Account ("Prior Matching Contribution
          Transfers") reduced by (B) the amount of the Participant's Prior
          Matching Contribution Transfers.  If a Participant has made a
          Diversification Election and has not made a subsequent
          Diversification Election with a lower percentage, a percentage of
          the value of all future allocations to the Participant's
          Participant Elected Contribution Account and Employer Matching
          Contribution Accounts respectively equal to the percentage of the
          Participant's Diversification Election shall be transferred to
          the Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account.<PAGE>

               If a Participant who has made a McDESOP Diversification
          Election, makes a new McDESOP Diversification Election at a
          percentage (including zero) lower than the percentage of the
          earlier McDESOP Diversification Election, no portion of the
          allocations to the Participant's Participant Elected Contribution
          Account and Employer Matching Contribution Accounts,
          respectively, shall be transferred to the McDESOP Diversification
          Account until the respective products of the new lower percentage
          elected multiplied by (A) the sum of the Participant Elected
          Contribution Account plus Prior Elected Contribution Transfers
          and (B) the sum of the Employer Matching Contribution Accounts
          plus Prior Matching Contribution Transfers exceed (A) the Prior
          Elected Contribution Transfers and (B) Prior Matching
          Contribution Transfers, at which time each such respective
          excess, and thereafter, a percentage of all future allocations
          respectively to the Participant's Participant Elected
          Contribution Account and Employer Matching Contribution Accounts
          equal to the percentage of the Participant's McDESOP
          Diversification Election shall be transferred to the
          Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account.  A McDESOP
          Diversification Election shall be made at the same time and with
          the same effective dates and such other rules as investment
          elections under Section 10.13.  Once a Participant has made a
          McDESOP Diversification Election of a given percentage it will
          continue in effect until he makes a new election.  A Participant
          can elect to reduce the percentage of his McDESOP Diversification
          Election to a larger or a lesser percentage (including to zero);
          however, amounts already credited to his McDESOP Diversification
          Account shall not be transferred back to his Participant Elected
          Contribution Account and his Employer Matching Contribution
          Accounts.

               (d)  Distributions from Diversification Accounts. The
          provisions of the Plan shall apply to amounts subject to a
          Diversification Election under Section 10.12 in the same manner
          as to the Participant Elected Contribution Accounts or Employer
          Matching Contribution Accounts, except that the balance in a
          Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account shall be invested
          in the Trust Investment Funds in the same manner as the
          Participant elects to invest his Profit Sharing Fund Account
          pursuant to Section 10.8 or as provided in Section 10.11(a),
          whichever is applicable, but determined without regard to Section
          10.7.  Contributions credited to a Participant's McDESOP
          Contribution Diversification Account shall be credited to the
          Investment Funds available under the Profit Sharing Plan in the
          same proportions as the Participant elects pursuant to Section
          10.8 or as provided in Section 10.11(a) whichever is applicable,
          but determined without regard to Section 10.7.  A Participant to
          whom a distribution is payable under Article X shall have the
          right to elect to receive any distributions made from his McDESOP
          Diversification Account in McDonald's common stock.

        10.13  Effective Date of Participant's Investment and
     Diversification Elections.  Effective prior to July 1, 1994, each
     Participant's investment election, pursuant to Sections 10.8, 10.9 and
     10.10 and a Diversification Election made pursuant to Section 10.12,
     shall be made effective as of such date or dates as the Committee
     shall, in accordance with uniform and non-discriminatory rules
     designate, or as soon thereafter as is administratively convenient.
     Effective July 1, 1994 and thereafter, each Participant's investment<PAGE>
     election or Diversification Election submitted by the 25th of a
     calendar month, pursuant to Sections 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10 and a
     Diversification Election made pursuant to Section 10.12, shall be made
     effective as of the first day of the next calendar month or as soon
     thereafter as is administratively convenient.  Diversification
     Elections with respect to future contributions made in accordance with
     Section 10.12 shall be implemented the first day of the calendar month
     after the month in which such contributions are made to the Plan or as
     soon thereafter as is administratively convenient.  This Section 10.13
     is intended to give the Committee the authority to implement
     Participants' Investment Elections and Diversification Elections as
     soon as possible with due regard for requiring advance notice of
     elections.  The Committee may use such methods as making transfers
     between Investment Funds based upon estimates followed by corrective
     adjustments made when exact data becomes available and, in the event
     of inability to effectuate elections because of data processing,
     communications or other systems breakdowns, the Committee may
     effectuate such elections as soon as is reasonable under the existing
     circumstances.

        10.14  Trust Income.  As of the close of business on each Valuation
     Date, the fair market value of the Trust Fund shall be determined.
     The fair market value of Assets Subject to Guarantee, as defined in
     Section 10.6(a)(3), shall be book value for all purposes hereunder
     unless the Committee determines that the book value guarantees no
     longer apply, a market value distribution has occurred under the
     contract or there has been a default on the guarantee.  The fair
     market value of the Trust Fund shall be determined, recorded and
     communicated in writing to the Committee by the Trustee.  The Trustee
     shall also determine the fair market value of each separate Investment
     Fund.  The Trustee's determination of fair market value shall be final
     and conclusive on all persons.  Once the values of each such
     Investment Fund have been determined, the value of each Trust Sub-fund
     invested in such Investment Fund shall be determined in accordance
     with Section 10.15.  Once the fair market value of each Trust Sub-fund
     invested in each Investment Fund is determined, the value of each
     Participant's Accounts held in such Trust Sub-fund shall be determined
     therefrom in accordance with Section 10.17.

     For purposes of valuation under Sections 10.15 and 10.16, the "daily
     weighted average" of amounts held under or transferred into a fund or
     account means the sum of the daily values of such amounts in the fund
     or account for each day of the month divided by the number of days in
     the month, determined by including amounts on the date of transfer
     into a fund or an account and excluding amounts on the date of
     transfer out of a fund or an account.

        10.15  Trust Sub-fund Income.  As of each Valuation Date, the
     Committee shall determine the adjustment required to be made to the
     value of each Trust Sub-fund to make the total of all Trust Sub-fund
     balances which are invested in an Investment Fund equal to the total
     value of the Investment Fund in the manner described below:

               (a)  Income Allocation to Trust Sub-funds Invested in the
          Diversified Stock Fund, Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock
          Fund, the Insurance Contract Fund, the Multi-Asset Fund, McDESOP
          McDonald's Preferred Stock Fund, McDESOP McDonald's Common Stock
          Fund or the Money Market Fund Subaccounts which are not directly
          credited with income.  The value of the portion of each Trust
          Sub-fund in the Profit Sharing Plan (including Participants'<PAGE>


          Diversification Accounts) invested in the Diversified Stock Fund,
          the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund, the Multi-Asset
          Fund, the Insurance Contract Fund, the Money Market Fund Sub
          accounts which are not directly credited with income pursuant to
          Section 10.6(a)(5) and the Participant Elected Contribution Sub-
          fund, the Employer Matching Contribution Sub-fund and to the
          extent not invested in Company Stock, the Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contribution Sub-fund and the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account
          invested in the McDESOP McDonald's Preferred Stock Fund or the
          McDESOP McDonald's Common Stock Fund as of a Valuation Date is
          equal to the product of (1) multiplied by (2) where:

                    (1)  is the value of the portion of such Trust Sub-fund
               invested in an Investment Fund as of the immediately
               preceding Valuation Date, reduced by the amount of any
               distributions therefrom since the immediately preceding
               Valuation Date, and

                    (2)  is a fraction the numerator of which is the value
               of the Investment Fund as of the Valuation Date reduced by
               the amount of any contributions credited thereto since the
               immediately preceding Valuation Date and the denominator of
               which is the value of such Investment Fund as of the
               immediately preceding Valuation Date reduced by the amount
               of any distributions from such Investment Fund since the
               immediately preceding Valuation Date.

               (b)  Income Allocation to Trust Sub-funds Invested in the
          Money Market Fund Subaccounts which are directly credited with
          income pursuant to Section 10.6(a)(6).  The value of the portion
          of each Trust Sub-fund in the Profit Sharing Plan invested in
          Profit Sharing Money Market Fund Subaccounts which are directly
          credited with income as of a Valuation Date shall be equal to the
          sum of (1) plus (2) where:

                    (1)  is the value of the portion of such Trust Sub-fund
               invested in a Money Market Fund Subaccount as of the
               immediately preceding Valuation Date, reduced by any
               transfers or distributions therefrom since the immediately
               preceding Valuation Date, and

                    (2)  is an amount equal to the income of the portion of
               the Trust Sub-fund invested in the Money Market Fund
               Subaccount since the immediately preceding Valuation Date.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dividends paid to the Trust
     with respect to Company Stock which was purchased with the proceeds of
     an Exempt Loan (or other loan permitted in accordance with Section 6.1
     including a loan which was refinanced with such loan) and any Company
     Stock into which such purchased shares have been converted, which has
     been allocated to Participants' Accounts and which are being used
     pursuant to Section 6.4(a) to repay such loan shall not be credited to
     Participants' Accounts but shall be credited to the Auxiliary ESOP
     Suspense Account maintained with respect to such loan pursuant to
     Section 6.2 and used to repay such loan; provided that the amount of
     any such dividends which are not used as of the last Valuation Date of
     a Plan Year to repay the loan shall be allocated to Participants'
     Accounts pursuant to Section 10.17 as of such Valuation Date.<PAGE>

        10.16  Income Directly Credited to Trust Sub-funds.  For the
     purpose of determining the allocation of income to Participants'
     Participant Elected Contribution Accounts as of a Valuation Date,
     there shall be added to the value of the Participant Elected
     Contribution Fund as of that Valuation Date an amount equal to the sum
     of (a) the income directly credited to the Participant Elected
     Contribution Holding Fund pursuant to Section 10.6 and (b) the income
     allocated to such Fund from the Distribution Fund in accordance with
     Section 10.18 for the period ending on such Valuation Date.  For the
     purpose of determining the allocation of income to Participants'
     Employer Matching Contribution Account as of a Valuation Date there
     shall be added to the value of the Employer Matching Contribution Fund
     as of that Valuation Date an amount equal to the sum of (a) the income
     directly credited to the Employer Matching Contribution Holding Fund
     and the Per Capita Employer Matching Contribution Holding Fund
     pursuant to Section 10.6 and (b) the income allocated to such Fund
     from the Distribution Fund in accordance with Section 10.18  for the
     period ending on such Valuation Date.  Any income directly credited to
     the Profit Sharing Contribution Holding Fund shall be allocated to
     Participant Accounts as part of the Profit Sharing Contribution
     Holding Fund as provided in Section 7.1.

        10.17  Adjustment of Account Balances.  As of each Valuation Date,
     the Committee shall determine the adjustment required to be made to
     the value of each Participant's Accounts and the Auxiliary ESOP
     Suspense Accounts to make the total of all such Account balances which
     are invested in an Investment Fund and held in a Trust Sub-fund equal
     to the total amount invested in that Investment Fund and held in that
     Trust Sub-fund.

               (a)  Valuation of the Portion of Profit Sharing Fund
          Accounts, Investment Savings Fund Accounts, Rollover Contribution
          Accounts, Diversification Accounts, Participant Elected
          Contribution Accounts and Employer Matching Contribution Accounts
          invested in an Investment Fund other than the Money Market Fund
          Subaccounts which are directly credited with income.  The value
          of the portion of each Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account,
          Investment Savings Fund Account, Rollover Contribution Account,
          Diversification Account, Participant Elected Contribution Account
          and Employer Matching Contribution Account invested in an
          Investment Fund other than the Money Market Fund Subaccounts
          which are directly credited with income pursuant to
          Section 10.6(a)(6) as of a Valuation Date shall be equal to the
          product for each Investment Fund of (1) multiplied by (2) where:

                    (1)  is the value of the portion of such Account held
               in a Trust Sub-fund and invested in an Investment Fund as of
               the immediately preceding Valuation Date, reduced by any
               distributions therefrom since the immediately preceding
               Valuation Date, and

                    (2)  is a fraction, the numerator of which is the value
               of the portion of the Trust Sub-fund invested in such
               Investment Fund as of the Valuation Date reduced by any
               contributions credited thereto since the immediately
               preceding Valuation Date and the denominator of which is the
               value of such portion of the Trust Sub-fund invested in such
               Investment Fund as of the immediately preceding Valuation
               Date reduced by any distributions therefrom since the
               immediately preceding Valuation Date.  In determining the<PAGE>
               value of the foregoing numerator for purposes of the
               Participant Elected Contribution Fund and the Employer
               Matching Contribution Fund, the income of the Participant
               Elected Contribution Holding Fund and the Employer Matching
               Contribution Holding Fund and the Per Capita Employer
               Matching Contribution Holding Fund shall be included in
               accordance with Section 10.16.

               (b)  Valuation of the Portion of Participants' Accounts
          Invested in the Money Market Fund.  The value of the portion of
          each Participant's Accounts held in a Trust Sub-fund and invested
          in a Money Market Fund Subaccount which is directly credited with
          income as of a Valuation Date shall be equal to the sum of (1)
          plus (2) where:

                    (1)  is the value of the portion of the Participant's
               Account held in a Trust Sub-fund and invested in the Money
               Market Fund Subaccount which is directly credited with
               income pursuant to Section 10.6(a)(b) as of the immediately
               preceding Valuation Date, reduced by any transfers or
               distributions therefrom since the immediately preceding
               Valuation Date, and

                    (2)  is an amount equal to the income of the portion of
               such Account held in a Trust Sub-fund and invested in the
               Money Market Fund Subaccount since the immediately preceding
               Valuation Date.  The income of such portion of such Account
               is equal to the product of (A) multiplied by (B) where:

                         (A)  is the difference between (i) the sum of (I)
                    the value of the portion of the Trust Sub-fund invested
                    in the Money Market Fund Subaccount as of the Valuation
                    Date plus (II) any transfers or distributions therefrom
                    since the immediately preceding Valuation Date, reduced
                    by (ii) the sum of (I) the value of such portion of the
                    Trust Sub-fund invested in the Money Market Fund
                    Subaccount as of the immediately preceding Valuation
                    Date plus (II) any contributions or other amounts
                    transferred thereto since the immediately preceding
                    Valuation Date; and

                         (B)  is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
                    daily weighted average value of the portion of the
                    Account held in the Trust Sub-fund and invested in the
                    Money Market Fund Subaccount for the period since the
                    immediately preceding Valuation Date, and the
                    denominator of which is the daily weighted average
                    value of the portion of the Trust Sub-fund invested in
                    the Money Market Fund Subaccount for the period since
                    the immediately preceding Valuation Date.

                    (3)  Valuation of the Portion of the Auxiliary ESOP
               Suspense Account and Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP
               Accounts invested in Company Stock.  Participants' Employer
               Auxiliary ESOP Accounts and Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Accounts
               shall be directly credited with the dividends and other
               distributions and earnings of shares of Company Stock
               credited thereto; provided that any dividends credited to
               Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP Accounts which are to
               be used to repay an Exempt Loan shall immediately after<PAGE>
               being so credited to Participants' Accounts be transferred
               to the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account and held in a
               separate account until used to repay a loan and further
               provided that the amount of such dividends transferred to
               the Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account for a Plan Year shall
               not exceed the fair market value of the Company Stock
               (determined on the Valuation Date allocated) allocated to
               Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP Accounts pursuant to
               Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year.

          The Accounts of Participants as adjusted according to
     Section 10.17 shall determine the value of the interest of each
     Participant in the Trust for all purposes subject to the crediting of
     any contributions as provided in Article VII until a subsequent
     determination is made by the Committee.

        10.18  Allocation of Income of the Distribution Fund.  Any net
     income and gains (after reduction by losses and by expenses not paid
     by an Employer) of the Distribution Fund shall be allocated to the
     Profit Sharing Plan and to McDESOP in proportion to the amount of
     distributions from each such portion of the Plan transferred to the
     Distribution Fund since the preceding Valuation Date.  The portion of
     such net income allocated to the Profit Sharing Plan shall be credited
     to Profit Sharing Contribution Holding Funds #1 and #2 in proportion
     to the Profit Sharing Contributions made thereto in accordance with
     Article III and shall be allocated to Participants' Profit Sharing
     Contribution Accounts in accordance with Section 7.1.  The portion of
     such income allocated to McDESOP shall be credited to Participants'
     Participant Elected Matched Contribution Accounts and Employer
     Matching Contribution Accounts in proportion to the income allocable
     thereto in accordance with Section 10.16.  Effective July 1, 1993, for
     purposes of making the foregoing allocations, distributions from
     Participants' Diversification Accounts shall be considered to be part
     of the McDESOP portion of the Plan.

        10.19  Separate Accounting in the Trust Fund.  The Committee shall
     create and maintain separate accounts for each Participant as
     described in Section 1.1.  Every adjustment to a Participant's
     Accounts shall be considered as having been made on the relevant
     Valuation Date, regardless of the date of actual entry or receipt by
     the Trustee of Employer Contributions and Participant Elected
     Contributions for a Plan Year.

        10.20  Trust Investment.  The assets of a Trust Fund may at any one
     time be invested up to 100% exclusively in Company Stock subject to
     the provisions of the Trust.

        10.21  Separate Accounting for Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account.
     The Committee shall create and maintain a separate account, called an
     Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account, to record and to separately account
     for (a) each loan or other extension of credit made pursuant to
     Section 6.1, (b) all Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions to the Plan
     to repay each such loan or extension of credit, (c) net income, gains
     or losses charged to such Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions and
     Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account under Sections 10.17 and 10.6(b), and
     (d) all payments made on such loan or other extension of credit until
     such loan or other extension of credit is repaid, in accordance with
     Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.<PAGE>

        10.22  Correction of Error.  In the event of any error, including
     but not limited to an error in the adjustment of a Participant's
     Accounts or an error in including or excluding persons as
     Participants, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may correct such
     error by either crediting or charging the adjustment required, or such
     adjustment as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine to
     be equitable, to make such correction to or against Forfeitures or to
     or against income and expenses of the Trust for the Plan Year in which
     the correction is made, or if an Employer contributes an amount to
     correct any such error, from such amount.

     Effective January 1, 1995, corrections of Participant Elected
     Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions which an individual
     should have been permitted to make, but because of an error in Plan
     administration was not permitted to make, shall be made as provided in
     the preceding sentence by crediting the individual's Participant
     Elected Contribution Account and Employer Matching Contribution
     Account respectively with (a) Participant Elected Contributions equal
     to the average percentage of compensation which was contributed for
     the preceding Plan Year as such contributions by highly compensated
     employees or non-highly compensated employees (whichever the
     individual is classified as) and (b) the amount of Employer Matching
     Contributions and Forfeitures which would have been credited to such
     individual's Employer Matching Contribution Account with respect to
     such Employer Matching Contributions.  After the preceding correction
     is made, the Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account
     and Employer Matching Contribution Account shall be credited with a
     rate of return which is equal to the rate of return the Participant's
     accounts would have received had the accounts been invested in the
     manner in which such accounts were invested at the time the
     Participant was first given the opportunity to make Participant
     Elected Contributions.

     Except as provided in this Section, the Accounts of other
     Participants shall not be readjusted on account of such error.

        10.23  Statement of Accounts.  As soon as practicable after the
     last day of each Plan Year, the Committee shall deliver to each
     Participant a statement of his Net Balance Account.

        10.24  Purchase or Sale of Company Stock.  The Trustee, on behalf
     of McDESOP, may (a) sell Company Stock to a Party in Interest or a
     Disqualified Person if such sale is for at least the fair market value
     of the Company Stock and (b) purchase Company Stock from a Party in
     Interest or a Disqualified Person, if such purchase is for no more
     than the fair market value of the Company Stock and (c) no commission
     is charged with respect to such sale or acquisition; provided that
     such sale or acquisition is for the price of the Company Stock
     prevailing on an established securities market, if the Company Stock
     is readily tradeable on such market and determined by an independent
     appraiser, if the Company Stock is not readily tradeable on an
     established securities market.

        10.25  Shareholder Rights in Company Stock.  A fundamental purpose
     of the McDESOP portion of the Plan and the Trust which is maintained
     to implement the McDESOP portion of the Plan is to obtain for the
     Company, its shareholders, Participants and future Participants the
     benefits resulting from Participants having the right to vote shares
     of Company Stock and to determine whether shares of Company Stock
     should be sold or retained in response to a public or private tender<PAGE>


     offer.  A key purpose of the McDESOP portion of the Plan is to
     encourage Participants to feel and to act like owners of the Company
     by assuring them the opportunity to share the economic benefit of
     ownership of Company Stock and the opportunity to direct the manner in
     which shares held by McDESOP are voted at all shareholder meetings and
     to determine whether shares of Company Stock should be sold or
     retained in response to a public or private tender offer.  It is
     similarly desired that Participants who elect to invest their profit
     sharing accounts in Company Stock have the same opportunity with
     respect to the shares held in Participants' Profit Sharing Accounts.
     The broad employee participation in the Plan at all levels of the
     Company and limitations on maximum benefits to Participants who are
     officers, shareholders or highly compensated employees assure that
     such voting and decisions by Participants represent the overall
     knowledge and experience of a broad representative cross-section of
     employees of the Company.  It, therefore, is anticipated that the
     votes and other decisions of Participants will be fairly
     representative of both present and future Participants' interests.
     Accordingly it has been concluded that Participants are best able to
     determine questions concerning voting and whether to sell or retain
     shares of Company Stock in a public or private tender offer with
     respect to shares allocated to their own accounts, as each person is
     uniquely able to determine his best interests based upon both his
     unique knowledge of his own situation and his unique knowledge of the
     Company.  Moreover, because the overall broad group of employees who
     are Participants is fairly representative of both present and future
     Participants' interests it is believed that such Participants as a
     group are uniquely able to determine the best interests of future
     Participants who benefit from future allocations of Company Stock
     under the Plan.  Further, such participation in fundamental
     shareholder decisions by Participants is expected to result in
     increased commitment to the success of the Company further enhancing
     financial rewards of plan participation for such Participants, as well
     as enhancing shareholder and Company values.  In order to assure that
     each Participant will express his or her unrestrained best judgment
     concerning how these rights should be exercised independent of any
     considerations associated with such Participant's employment status
     with the Company, Participants exercise such rights through a method
     that assures the confidentiality of their votes and other decisions.

               (a)  Allocated Shares.  With respect to shares (and
          fractional shares) of Company Stock which have been allocated to
          Participants' Accounts (including shares held in the Profit
          Sharing McDonald's Stock Fund with respect to amounts credited to
          Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account or Diversification
          Account), each Participant or Beneficiary, as a named fiduciary,
          shall have the right to direct the Trustee as to the manner of
          voting and the exercise of all other rights which a shareholder
          of record has with respect to such shares (including, but not
          limited to, the right to sell or retain such shares in a public
          or private tender offer).  In voting or exercising such other
          rights with respect to such shares the Participants and
          Beneficiaries shall consider their own individual long-term best
          interests in providing benefits under the Plan and Trust rather
          than a short term gain.  In the event that a Participant shall
          fail to direct the Trustee as to the manner of voting of such
          shares of Company Stock allocated to the Participant's Accounts
          or as to the exercise of other rights in respect of such shares,
          the Trustee shall vote such shares or exercise such rights with
          respect to such shares in accordance with Section 10.25(b).<PAGE>

               (b)  Unallocated Shares and Allocated Shares Not Directed.
          With respect to shares (and fractional shares) of Company Stock
          which are either not allocated to Participants' Accounts or are
          allocated to the Accounts of Participants who fail (or whose
          Beneficiaries fail) to provide any direction pursuant to Section
          10.25(a), each Participant who is an Employee, as a named
          fiduciary, shall have the right to direct the Trustee as to the
          manner of voting the number of such shares (and fractional
          shares), and the exercise of all other rights which a shareholder
          of record has with respect to such shares (including, but not
          limited to, the right to sell or retain such shares in a public
          or private tender offer), as is equal to the product of (i) the
          sum of the number of unallocated shares and undirected shares
          multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
          number of shares (and fractional shares) of Company Stock which
          have been allocated to the Accounts of such Participant and the
          denominator of which is the total number of shares (and
          fractional shares) of Company Stock which have been allocated to
          the Accounts of all Participants who give directions to the
          Trustee pursuant to this Section 10.25(b).  In voting or
          exercising such other rights with respect to such shares such
          Participants shall consider the long term interests of both
          current and future Participants and Beneficiaries in providing
          benefits under the Plan and Trust rather than a short term gain.

               (c)  Named Fiduciaries.  The Trustee shall notify each
          Participant and Beneficiary who is authorized pursuant to Section
          10.25(a) or (b) to direct the Trustee as to the manner of voting
          and the exercise of other shareholder rights with respect to
          shares (and fractional shares) of Company Stock that such
          Participant or Beneficiary is a named fiduciary, within the
          meaning of Section 402(a)(2) of ERISA, with respect to such
          shares (and fractional shares), and shall instruct each such
          Participant and Beneficiary that in exercising such authority to
          direct the Trustee, with respect to shares of Company Stock
          allocated to his Accounts, he should consider his own individual
          long-term best interests in providing benefits under the Plan
          and, with respect to shares of Company Stock voted pursuant to
          Section 10.25(b), he should consider the long-term interests of
          both current and future Participants and Beneficiaries in
          providing benefits under the Plan and Trust rather than a short
          term gain.

               (d)  Confidentiality.  The Trustee shall solicit the
          directions of Participants and Beneficiaries in accordance with
          Section 10.25(a), (b) and (c) and shall follow such directions by
          delivering aggregated votes to the Company or otherwise
          implementing such directions in any convenient manner which
          preserves the confidentiality of the votes or other directions of
          individual Participants or Beneficiaries.  Any designee of the
          Trustee who assists in the solicitation or tabulation of the
          directions of Participants or Beneficiaries shall certify that he
          will maintain the confidentiality of all directions given.

        10.26  Cash Distributions with Respect to Company Stock.  If there
     is a discrepancy between (1) the amount received by the Trust upon the
     sale of Company Stock or credited to a portion of the Trust upon the
     transfer of Company Stock from one portion of the Trust to another,
     for the purpose of making cash distributions to Participants or<PAGE>
     Beneficiaries and (2) the value of such Company Stock on the Valuation
     Date as of which such stock is valued for the purpose of determining
     the amount of the Participant's cash distributions, such discrepancy
     shall be credited to or charged against the Trust Income of the
     portion of the Trust Fund (i.e., the Profit Sharing Plan Accounts, the
     Leveraged ESOP Accounts and the remaining McDESOP Accounts) which held
     the stock before sale or transfer as of the Valuation Date next
     following the sale or transfer.

        10.27  Distribution Fund.  Any of the provisions herein to the
     contrary notwithstanding, the Committee shall have the authority to
     direct a Trustee to transfer amounts which in accordance with Article
     XI are currently distributable in cash to Participants or
     Beneficiaries who have had a Termination of Employment or, in the case
     of the Profit Sharing Plan, a Break in Service, to a Distribution Fund
     ("Distribution Fund"), during the calendar month next following the
     calendar month within which such amount became distributable.  The
     Distribution Fund shall be held (a) in a checking account of the
     Trustee in the name of the Trust with, if the Trustee is a bank or a
     Trust Company, the Trustee's banking department, or (b) in short term
     liquid investments, in such types of investments or pooled, common,
     commingled or collective trust funds, including, if the Trustee is a
     bank, those of the Trustee, as the Committee may from time to time
     authorize the Trustee to invest in such respective amounts and
     proportions and in such manner as the Committee shall from time to
     time determine.  The Committee may authorize one or more of its
     members, or their designees, to sign, manually, or by facsimile
     signature, any and all checks, drafts, and orders, including orders or
     directions in informal or letter form, against any funds in the
     Distribution Fund and the Trustee is authorized to honor any and all
     checks, drafts and orders so signed.  As of each Valuation Date,
     income, gains, losses and expenses (to the extent not paid by an
     Employer) of the Distribution Fund shall be determined separately from
     the remainder of the Trust and the net income or losses of the
     Distribution Fund, for each Plan Year shall be added to the net income
     of the Trust Fund for such Plan Year as provided in Section 10.18 and
     any net losses of the Distribution Fund for the Plan Year shall be
     paid by the Company.

                    companies, with the Participant's vested Net Balance
                    Account credited to his Accounts or with the portion of

               Employment for reasons other than retirement on or after his

                         1/2, but not later than his Required Beginning
                         Date.

                              A Participant entitled to elect to receive a
                         distribution or to commence receiving
                         distributions pursuant to this Section 11.2(a)(2)

               Service without having a Termination of Employment, the
               Trustee shall distribute the portion of his vested Net
               Balance Account in the Profit Sharing Plan in cash and in a
               single non-periodic payment within a reasonable time after
               the earlier of the Valuation Date next following the date
               the Participant elects to receive such distribution or after
               the Participant attains the age of 70-1/2, but not later
               than his Required Beginning Date; provided that if the
               Participant completes one year of Eligibility Service
               following the Break in Service, he shall not be permitted
               further elections to receive distributions made pursuant to
               Article XI until he again has a Break in Service or
               Termination of Employment.

               (b)  Elections by Retired or Disabled Participants.  As
          permitted in Section 11.2(a)(1), with respect to a distribution
          on account of a Participant's Termination of Employment on or
          after his Vesting Retirement Date or on account of Disability, a
          Participant may elect separately with respect to the portion of
          his Net Balance Account held in the Profit Sharing Plan and in
          McDESOP, on such form as may be provided or approved by the
          Committee, the form of benefit and the date (including an
          immediate or a delayed date) of commencement of benefits.  The
          actual date of distribution shall be determined in accordance
          with the administrative procedures established by the Plan
          Administrator but shall be no earlier than the day following the
          Valuation Date which next follows the date the completed election
          form is submitted to the Plan Administrator.  To the extent that
          such a Participant is receiving a portion of his benefit in a
          form other than an annuity purchased from an insurance company,
          he may from time to time make or change his benefit elections to
          accelerate or to delay the date and the rate of distribution on
          such a form as may be provided or approved by the Committee,
          subject to such rules as the Committee shall specify and to the
          limits stated in Sections 11.2(d) and 11.2(e), hereof.  In the
          absence of any election, a Participant who has a Termination of
          Employment on or after his Vesting Retirement Date or on account
          of Disability shall be deemed to have elected to receive the
          vested portion of his Net Balance Account in a single
          non-periodic payment paid within a reasonable time after the end
          of the calendar year in which he attains age 70-1/2, but not
          later than his Required Beginning Date.<PAGE>

               (c)  Types of Annuities.  If the Participant elects to
          receive his benefit in the form of an annuity contract as
          permitted under Section 11.2(a)(1), each Participant, subject to
          Sections 11.2(d) and 11.2(e) shall have the right to direct the
          Trustee to purchase an available nontransferable annuity contract
          from an insurance company designated by the Participant which is
          authorized to do business in any state and which has an A plus
          rating by A.M. Best Company or a comparable rating by a
          comparable service which rates insurance companies.  The benefit
          under such annuity contract shall be paid to the Participant
          prior to his death, and if a joint and survivor annuity is
          provided, unless such joint annuitant shall be the Participant's
          spouse, the periodic benefit payable to the Participant's
          Beneficiary shall not be greater than the following percentage of
          the benefit paid to the Participant:

               Excess of age of employee          Applicable
                over age of beneficiary           percentage

               If benefits are paid in the form of an annuity with a period
               certain feature, the number of years over which such period
               certain payments are made shall not exceed the lesser of
               (1) the Participant's or the Participant's and Beneficiary's
               joint and last survivor life expectancy as determined in
               Section 11.12(e) or (2) the number of years shown in the
               Applicable Divisor column above.

               (e)  Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuities.

                    (1)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
               Section 11.2, in the case of a Participant who has elected
               pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(1) to receive one or more of his
               Accounts in a life annuity, such distribution shall be in
               the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity purchased
               by the Trust from an insurance company designated by the
               Participant which is authorized to do business in any state
               and which has an A plus rating by A.M. Best Company or a
               comparable rating by a comparable service which rates
               insurance companies, unless the Participant with his
               spouse's consent as provided in Section 11.10 elects to
               receive a different form of annuity or another form of
               benefit.  The term "Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity"
               means an immediate annuity payable, for a married
               Participant, to the Participant for life and, if the
               Participant's spouse survives the Participant, a survivor
               annuity payable to the spouse for life in an amount equal to
               50 percent (50%) of the annuity payable to the Participant
               and, for an unmarried Participant, a single life annuity<PAGE>
               payable to the Participant for life.  The amount of the
               benefits payable under a Qualified Joint and Survivor
               Annuity shall be the amount which can be purchased from an
               insurance company with the vested portion of the one or more
               of his Accounts which the Participant elects to receive in
               the form of a life annuity.

                    (2)  If a Participant who has elected to receive all or
               a portion of his vested Net Balance Account in the form of a
               life annuity dies before the annuity starting date, such
               portion of his vested Net Balance Account shall be paid to
               his surviving spouse in the form of a Qualified
               Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving
               spouse for life ("QPSA") unless either the Participant, with
               his spouse's consent in accordance with Section 11.10, has
               elected to waive the QPSA or the spouse elects pursuant to
               Section 11.3(a)(3) to waive the QPSA and to receive another
               form of benefit; provided that if the Trust has paid for an
               annuity to provide a life annuity benefit elected by the
               Participant and the Participant dies before his annuity
               starting date under the contract, the QPSA shall be provided
               by the annuity contract and the surviving spouse shall have
               no claim against the Trust with respect to the Accounts
               which he has elected to receive in the form of a life
               annuity.  Any portion of a Participant's vested Net Balance
               Account in excess of the value of a QPSA, if paid directly
               by the Plan, or remaining after the payment of annuity
               premiums to an insurance company, if paid by an insurance
               company, shall be distributed to the Participant's
               Beneficiary as provided in Section 11.3.

                    (3)  A Participant who elects to receive benefits in
               the form of a life annuity and to whom benefits would be
               payable in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor
               Annuity pursuant to this Section 11.2(e) shall have the
               right to waive a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (such
               waiver shall be consented to by the Participant's spouse in
               writing in accordance with Section 11.10) and the QPSA by
               delivering written notice to the Committee, at any time
               within the 90 day period prior to the annuity starting date,
               to receive all or a portion of such benefits in a different
               form of annuity or another form of benefit.  If a
               Participant elects to receive benefits in the form of a life
               annuity, the Committee shall within a reasonable period of
               time provide the Participant, by personal delivery or first
               class mail, with a written explanation of:

                         (A)  the terms and conditions of the Qualified
                    Joint and Survivor Annuity and the QPSA;

                         (B)  the Participant's right to make, and the
                    effect of, an election to waive the Qualified Joint and
                    Survivor Annuity and the QPSA;

                         (C)  the rights of the Participant's spouse to
                    consent to the Participant's election to waive the
                    Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the QPSA and
                    the effect of consenting to such waiver; and<PAGE>

                         (D)  the Participant's right to make, and the
                    effect of, a revocation of an election to waive the
                    Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the QPSA.

               Any election made by a Participant to receive a life annuity
          form of benefit pursuant to this Section 11.2(e) may be revoked
          by such Participant (with his spouse's consent) by delivering
          written notice to the Committee at any time prior to the
          Participant's annuity starting date and, once revoked, may be
          made again at any time by delivering written notice to the
          Committee prior to the Participant's annuity starting date.  If a
          Participant, who has elected a life annuity form of benefit and
          who has not waived (with his spouse's consent) the QPSA, dies
          before his annuity starting date, his surviving spouse may elect
          pursuant to (A) through (D) and Section 11.10 to waive the QPSA.

               (f)  Form of Profit Sharing Distributions.  If the method of
          distribution selected by a Participant includes either a
          nonperiodic payment or installment payments or a combination of
          nonperiodic payments and installments, the Participant may elect,
          on such form and in such manner as the Committee shall provide or
          permit, to receive the portion of his vested Net Balance Account
          in the Profit Sharing Plan distributed in cash or in shares of
          McDonald's common stock or in any combination of the two as
          elected by the Participant; provided however that, in the absence
          of an election to receive shares of McDonald's common stock, such
          distributions shall be made in cash and, further provided, that
          the portion of such distribution distributed in the form of
          shares of McDonald's common stock shall not, except as otherwise
          provided below, exceed the value (if any) of the Participant's
          interest in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund.

               Until such time as a Participant's vested Net Balance
          Account has been distributed, transferred to a Distribution Fund
          in accordance with Section 10.27 or forfeited in accordance with
          Section 11.4, any portion of the Participant's Net Balance
          Account remaining in the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Plan
          shall continue to be invested in accordance with Section 10.7 and
          the Participant's (or his Beneficiary's) investment elections in
          accordance with Sections 10.8, 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11, as
          applicable.

               (g)  McDESOP Accounts.  If the sum of the portion of a
          Participant's vested balances in his Participant Elected
          Contribution Account, Employer Matching Contribution Account and
          McDESOP Diversification Account to the extent it is attributable
          to amounts diversified from his Participant Elected Contributions
          or Employer Matching Contribution Account and is invested in
          McDonald's common stock, consists of $1500 or more as of the
          Valuation Date immediately preceding a distribution, such amounts
          shall be distributed in the form of shares of McDonald's common
          stock, unless the Participant (or his Beneficiary) elects a
          distribution in cash.  If the sum of the portion of a
          Participant's vested balance in his Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contribution Accounts and his LESOP Diversification Account to
          the extent it is invested in McDonald's common stock consists of
          $1500 or more as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the
          date of distribution, such accounts shall be distributed in the
          form of shares of McDonald's common stock, unless the Participant
          (or his Beneficiary) elects a distribution in cash.  If the sum<PAGE>
          of the portion of a Participant's vested balance in his
          Participant Elected Contribution Account, Employer Matching
          Contribution Account and his Diversification Account to the
          extent it is attributable to his Participant Elected
          Contributions or Employer Matching Contributions and is invested
          in McDonald's common stock is less than $1500 as of the Valuation
          Date immediately preceding the distribution, such Accounts shall
          be distributed in cash, unless the Participant (or his
          Beneficiary) elects to receive a distribution in shares of
          McDonald's common stock.  If the sum of the portion of a
          Participant's vested Net Balance Account in his Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account and his LESOP Diversification
          Account to the extent it is attributable to his Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contributions and is invested in McDonald's common
          stock has a value of less than $1500 as of the Valuation Date
          immediately preceding the distribution, such Accounts shall be
          distributed in cash, unless the Participant (or his Beneficiary)
          elects to receive a distribution in shares of McDonald's common
          stock.

               If any distribution in shares of McDonald's common stock
          described in this Section 11.2 would not be in whole shares, the
          value of any fractional share shall be distributed in cash.  A
          Participant or Beneficiary who is entitled to a distribution may
          elect to receive a cash distribution in lieu of McDonald's common
          stock or a McDonald's common stock distribution in lieu of cash
          by filing a written election with the Committee on forms approved
          by the Committee and in a manner prescribed by the Committee on
          or before the Valuation Date coincident with or next preceding
          the date of distribution.

               Until such time as a Participant's vested Net Balance
          Account has been distributed, transferred to a Distribution Fund
          in accordance with Section 10.27, or forfeited in accordance with
          Section 11.4 (A) any portion of his Net Balance Account in his
          Diversification Account shall continue to be invested as provided
          in Section 10.12(b), and (B) any portion of his Net Balance
          Account remaining in the McDESOP portion of the Plan shall
          continue to be invested in Company Stock and held therein.

               If any Company Stock distributed from a Participant's
          Participant Elected Contribution Account, Employer Matching
          Contribution Account or Diversification Account is not readily
          tradeable on an established market when distributed, the
          distributee shall have the put option rights which are described
          in Section 6.5(b) with respect to such shares.

               (h)  Distributions After Rehire.  If a Participant who has
          had a Termination of Employment subsequently becomes an Employee,
          such Participant shall not be entitled to elect distributions
          until he again becomes eligible to receive distributions as
          provided in Section 11.2.

        11.3   Payment of Net Balance Account on Death of Participant.

               (a)  Form of Payment.  The Net Balance Account of a
          Participant who dies before having a Termination of Employment
          shall be fully vested.  The Net Balance Account of a Participant
          who dies after having a Termination of Employment for reasons
          other than a Termination of Employment on or after Vesting<PAGE>
          Retirement Date, death or Disability shall be vested as provided
          in Section 11.4(b).  If a Participant dies before his entire
          vested Net Balance Account has been paid from the Plan, except to
          the extent otherwise provided in Section 11.2(e)(2),
          distributions shall be made as follows:

                    (1)  If the Participant has a surviving spouse, the
               Trustee shall distribute the vested portion of the
               Participant's Net Balance Account to the Participant's
               surviving spouse as the Participant's Beneficiary in
               accordance with Section 11.3(a)(3) unless the Participant
               (with his spouse's consent in accordance with Section 11.10)
               has named another Beneficiary.

                    (2)  If the Participant does not have a surviving
               spouse or if the Participant (with his spouse's written
               consent in accordance with Section 11.10) has named another
               Beneficiary, the Trustee shall distribute the vested portion
               of the Participant's Net Balance Account in accordance with
               Section 11.3(a)(3) to the Beneficiary named by the
               Participant in accordance with Section 11.6.

                    (3)  The Participant's vested Net Balance Account shall
               be distributed within a reasonable time after the Valuation
               Date following the Participant's death or at such later date
               as the Beneficiary may elect under Section 11.3(b).
               Distributions to the Participant's Beneficiary shall be in
               whichever of the following methods of payment the
               Beneficiary, by written notice to the Committee, shall elect
               unless the Participant has elected in a written notice
               delivered to the Committee not to permit such Beneficiary
               elections in which case the Participant shall elect the
               method of payment, from the following:

                         (A)  A single non-periodic payment;

                         (B)  Substantially equal installments, not less
                    frequently than annually, over a period certain,
                    directly from the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
                    Plan; or

                         (C)  In the form of a nontransferable annuity
                    contract purchased from an insurance company designated
                    by the Beneficiary which is authorized to do business
                    in any state and which has an A plus rating by A.M.
                    Best Company or a comparable rating by a comparable
                    service which rates insurance companies payable to the
                    Beneficiary over his life.

               In the absence of any election by a Participant or a
          Beneficiary as to time and manner of payment, the Participant and
          the Beneficiary shall be deemed to have elected to receive the
          benefit in an immediate single sum payment.  Distributions shall
          be made to a Participant's Beneficiary in cash or in Company
          Stock under the conditions provided in Sections 11.2(f) and
          11.2(g).

               (b)  Beneficiary Elections.  With respect to a distribution
          on account of a Participant's death, his Beneficiary, as
          designated pursuant to Section 11.6, may elect the form of<PAGE>
          benefit and the date of commencement of benefits, unless the
          Participant has elected not to permit such Beneficiary elections.
          If the Participant has not elected otherwise, the Beneficiary may
          also elect, with respect to benefits not being received in the
          form of an annuity, to accelerate or to delay the receipt of
          benefits.  Such elections shall be made in writing on a form
          provided or approved by the Committee and are subject to such
          rules as the Committee shall specify and to the limits stated in
          Sections 11.3(c), 11.3(d), 11.3(e) and 11.3(f), as applicable.
          Once a Beneficiary has made benefit elections, he may in the same
          manner and subject to the same conditions, with respect to
          benefits not being received in the form of an annuity contract
          purchased from an insurance company, change the election at any
          time, and with respect to any election delay or accelerate the
          receipt of benefits from time to time.

               (c)  Period of Distribution - Death After Distributions
          Commence.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan and
          any elections made by the Participant or his Beneficiary, except
          an election made in accordance with Section 11.13(a), if a
          Participant dies on or after his Required Beginning Date but
          before his entire vested Net Balance Account has been
          distributed, and on or after the date upon which distribution of
          his vested Net Balance Account has commenced in installments over
          a period certain:

                    (1)  not in excess of the life expectancy of the
               Participant or the joint and last survivor life expectancy
               of the Participant and his Beneficiary and such life
               expectancy was not subject to redetermination under Section
               11.12(b), the balance of the Participant's vested Net
               Balance Account shall be distributed to his Beneficiary at
               least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in
               effect on the date of the Participant's death; or

                    (2)  not in excess of the life expectancy or life
               expectancies which are subject to periodic redetermination
               in accordance with Section 11.12(b), the balance of the
               Participant's vested Net Balance Account shall be
               distributed to his Beneficiary (A) by the last day of the
               Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant
               died, if the period was based solely upon the Participant's
               life expectancy and (B) over a period not longer than the
               Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy as determined under
               the method of determining life expectancy used for the
               Beneficiary at the time benefit payments commenced to the
               Participant, if the period was based upon the joint and last
               survivor life expectancy of the Participant and the
               Beneficiary.  The remaining life expectancy of a Beneficiary
               for purposes of the preceding sentence shall be (1) if such
               life expectancy is not subject to redetermination, the
               Beneficiary's life expectancy at the time installment
               payments commenced to be made to the Participant reduced by
               one year for each year over which such payments have been
               made or (2) if such life expectancy is subject to
               redetermination, the Beneficiary's life expectancy as
               redetermined at the applicable times following the
               Participant's death.<PAGE>

               (d)  Period of Distribution - Death Before Distributions
          Commence.  Notwithstanding any elections made by a Participant or
          Beneficiary, if Section 11.3(c) is not applicable, and a
          Participant dies before his entire vested Net Balance Account has
          been distributed or commenced to be distributed, the
          Participant's vested Net Balance Account shall be distributed not
          later than December 31 of the calendar year which contains the
          fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; except that if his
          Beneficiary is an individual, the Participant's vested Net
          Balance Account may be distributed over a period not exceeding
          the Beneficiary's life expectancy (or, if there are multiple
          Beneficiaries, the Beneficiary with the shortest life expectancy)
          determined as of the date of the Participant's death, and if the
          Beneficiary is a trust, his vested Net Balance Account may be
          distributed over a period not exceeding the life expectancy,
          determined as of the Participant's death, of the beneficiary of
          the trust or estate who then has the shortest life expectancy,
          beginning no later than December 31 of the calendar year after
          the calendar year of the Participant's death to the extent
          permitted under Section 11.3(h).  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
          if the Beneficiary is the Participant's surviving spouse,
          distribution shall be made or shall commence not later than
          December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would
          have attained the age of 70-1/2 years.

               (e)  Death of Surviving Spouse Who Is Beneficiary Before
          Benefit Payments Commence.  If the surviving spouse of a
          Participant is the Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies
          before distributions have begun to the surviving spouse in
          accordance with Section 11.3(c)(1) or (2), the rules of Sections
          11.3(c) and 11.3(d) shall apply as though such surviving spouse
          were the Participant, substituting the date of death of such
          spouse for the date of the Participant's death to determine the
          dates therein.  Distributions are considered to have begun to the
          surviving spouse on the later of the dates specified in Section
          11.3(c)(1) or (2).

               (f)  Death of Beneficiary After Benefit Payments Commence.
          If a Beneficiary has commenced to receive distributions under
          Section 11.3(d), and such Beneficiary dies before the entire
          vested Net Balance Account has been distributed, any subsequent
          Beneficiary whose status as a Beneficiary was contingent on the
          death of the first Beneficiary shall receive distributions at
          least as rapidly as under the distribution method in effect upon
          the first Beneficiary's death.

               (g)  Amount Paid to a Child.  Any amount paid to a child, in
          accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the
          Treasury, shall be treated as if it had been paid to the
          Participant's surviving spouse if such amount will become payable
          to the surviving spouse upon such child reaching majority (or
          such other events as the Secretary of the Treasury may by
          regulations prescribe).

               (h)  Trust as Beneficiary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
          provisions of Section 11.3, if a trust is designated the
          Beneficiary under the Plan and

                    (1)  if the following requirements below are met, the
               Beneficiary or Beneficiaries of the trust shall be<PAGE>
               considered the Beneficiary in accordance with applicable
               regulations and rulings for the purpose of determining the
               period over which distributions in the form of installments
               or annuities may be distributed.  The applicable trust
               requirements are:

                         (A)  the trust is a valid trust under state law,
                    or would be but for the fact that there is no corpus;

                         (B)  the trust is irrevocable, as of the
                    Participant's death;

                         (C)  the beneficiaries of the trust with respect
                    to the trust's interest in the Participant's vested Net
                    Balance Account are identifiable; and

                         (D)  a copy of the trust instrument is provided to
                    the Plan Administrator; and

                    (2)  If the above listed requirements are not met and
               the Participant dies on or after the Participant's Required
               Beginning Date, the Participant shall be treated as not
               having designated a Beneficiary for purposes of determining
               the period over which distributions may be made and
               distributions shall be made to the trust at least as rapidly
               as over the longest period over which distributions could
               have been made under Section 11.3(c) if the Participant had
               no Beneficiary.

                    (3)  If the above listed requirements are not met, and
               the Participant dies before his Required Beginning Date, the
               Participant shall be treated as not having designated a
               Beneficiary for purposes of the exception to the requirement
               in Section 11.3(d) that distributions be made within five
               years and distributions shall be made within the five year
               period designated in Section 11.3(d).

        11.4   Vesting and Forfeitures.

               (a)  A Participant who has a Termination of Employment on or
          after his Vesting Retirement Date or who has a Termination of
          Employment on account of Disability or death shall be fully
          vested in his Net Balance Account.

               (b)  If a Participant has a Break in Service or has a
          Termination of Employment with the Employer for reasons other
          than retirement on or after his Vesting Retirement Date, death,
          or Disability, such Participant shall be fully vested in his
          (1) Investment Savings Fund Account; (2) Participant Contribution
          Holding Account; (3) his Rollover Contribution Account;
          (4) Rollover Contribution Holding Account; (5) Participant
          Elected Contribution Account; and (6) Employer Matching
          Contribution Account.  Such Participant shall be vested in his
          Profit Sharing Fund Account and his Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contribution Account in accordance with the following table
          wherein the first column represents the Credited Service of the
          Participant, and the second column represents the Vested
          Percentage of the Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account and
          Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account:<PAGE>

               Years of Credited Service          Vested Percentage
               -------------------------          -----------------
               less than 2 years                       0
               2 years but less than 3                 5
               3 years but less than 4                 20
               4 years but less than 5                 40
               5 years but less than 6                 60
               6 years but less than 7                 80
               7 years and over                        100

               (c)  The portion of the Participant's Profit Sharing Fund
          Account and Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account which is
          not vested as of his Termination of Employment or the occurrence
          of a Break in Service shall become a Forfeiture at the earlier of
          (1) the first day of the Plan Year immediately following the Plan
          Year in which the Participant has five consecutive Breaks in
          Service or (2) as of the Valuation Date immediately following the
          Valuation Date as of which the Vested Percentage of the
          Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account and Employer Auxiliary
          ESOP Contribution Account, respectively, are distributed.
          Subject to Section 11.3(d) and 11.3(e), (A) Forfeitures occurring
          with respect to a Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account shall
          be credited to the Employer Matching Contribution Holding Fund as
          of the Valuation Date following the date the amount of such
          Forfeiture is determined but not later than the sixth Valuation
          Date after the date as of which the amounts became a Forfeiture
          and (B) from Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution
          Accounts shall be allocated for the Plan Year among all Active
          Participants as provided in Section 7.3 for Forfeitures from
          Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts.  A
          Participant whose Vested Percentage is zero at the time of his
          Termination of Employment or Break in Service shall be deemed to
          have had a distribution of the Vested Percentage of his Profit
          Sharing Fund Account and Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution
          Account as of the Valuation Date immediately following the date
          on which the Participant has a Termination of Employment or Break
          in Service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the vested portion
          of a Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account and Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account was distributed as of a
          Valuation Date in 1992 before July 1, the unvested portion of
          such account balances shall become a Forfeiture as of June 30,
          1992.

               (d)  If a Participant, (1) who had a Termination of
          Employment, resumes employment with an Employer before he has a
          Break in Service or, (2) who had a Termination of Employment or
          Break in Service occurring on or after January 1, 1985, earns one
          Year of Eligibility Service following the Break in Service (but
          before having five consecutive Breaks in Service), the amount of
          the Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account and Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account, if any, forfeited under
          Section 11.4(c) shall be reinstated to the respective Accounts
          out of Forfeitures from the Profit Sharing portion and the
          leveraged ESOP portion of the McDESOP portion of the Plan,
          respectively, for the Plan Year in which such resumption of
          employment occurs or such one Year of Eligibility Service is
          earned, whichever is applicable.  To the extent that Forfeitures
          for such Plan Year are not sufficient, the amount to be
          reinstated shall be charged against income of the Profit Sharing
          Fund and the Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Fund,<PAGE>
          respectively.  Thereafter, in the case of a Participant who
          received a distribution and had his Forfeiture reinstated, the
          Participant's Vested Percentage in his Profit Sharing Fund
          Account or Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account shall be
          equal to an amount determined by subtracting the amount
          distributed (the "Distributed Amount") on the Participant's
          Termination of Employment or Break in Service from the product of
          (1) the Participant's Vested Percentage determined pursuant to
          Section 11.4 multiplied by (2) the sum of (a) the Distributed
          Amount and (b) the value of the Participant's Profit Sharing Fund
          Account or Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account,
          respectively.

               (e)  The amount, if any, forfeited under Section 11.4(c)
          shall not be reinstated if a Participant is rehired or again
          becomes a Participant and if the Participant (1) had a Break in
          Service before January 1, 1985 or (2) did not have a Break in
          Service before January 1, 1985 and had five consecutive Breaks in
          Service.  If all or a portion of the Vested Percentage of a
          Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account or Employer Auxiliary
          ESOP Contribution Account prior to his Termination of Employment
          or Break in Service was not distributed prior to his resumption
          of service and he was not 100% vested upon Termination of
          Employment or Break in Service, then:  (1) the Vested Percentage
          of the Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account or Employer
          Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account at the time of Forfeiture
          which was not distributed shall be held in a "Pre-Break Profit
          Sharing Fund Account" and "Pre-Break Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contribution Account," respectively, which shall be 100% vested;
          and (2) the Participant's Profit Sharing Contributions and the
          net earnings thereon and Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions
          and the net earnings thereon attributable to service after the
          Break in Service or five (5) consecutive Breaks in Service, as
          applicable, shall be held in a "Post-Break Profit Sharing Fund
          Account," and "Post-Break Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contributions,"
          respectively, which shall be vested in accordance with Section
          11.4(b).

               (f)  Each Participant who is a certified swing manager,
          primary maintenance employee, crew member or other hourly
          restaurant employee who is an Employee on July 1, 1992, shall be
          fully vested in his Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account
          as of July 1, 1992.

        11.5   Payment of Employer Profit Sharing Contribution for Year of
     Termination of Employment.  If a Participant (or the Beneficiary
     thereof) who is an Active Participant for the Plan Year in which or
     immediately before which he has a Termination of Employment receives
     an allocation of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions pursuant to
     Section 7.1, an allocation of Company Stock released from the
     Auxiliary ESOP Suspense Account pursuant to Section 7.3 or an
     allocation of Employer Matching Contributions and Forfeitures pursuant
     to Section 7.2 after he has received a single sum distribution of his
     Net Balance Account, the vested portion of any such allocation shall
     be distributed to the Participant or, in the event of his death, to
     his Beneficiary within a reasonable time after the later of the close
     of the Plan Year or the Valuation Date following the Participant's
     election to receive such distribution.  If such Participant or
     Beneficiary has not received a single sum distribution of his vested
     Net Balance Account, any such allocations pursuant to Sections 7.1,<PAGE>
     7.2 and 7.3 for the Plan Year shall be credited to the Participant's
     Profit Sharing Fund Account, Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution
     Account and Employer Matching Contribution Account, respectively, and
     the vested portion of such contributions shall be distributed as a
     part of such account in the manner provided in Section 11.2 or 11.3,
     whichever shall apply.

        11.6   Designation of Beneficiary and Form of Beneficiary Benefit.
     Subject to Sections 11.3 and 11.10, the Participant may (1) designate
     his Beneficiary, (2) elect the form of his Beneficiary's benefit and
     (3) elect to prohibit Beneficiary elections under Section 11.3(b) on
     forms provided by and filed with the Committee; provided that a
     beneficiary designation completed and filed with the Committee before
     January 1, 1989, under the McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit
     Sharing Plan shall be deemed to apply to the Profit Sharing Plan
     portion of the Plan and a beneficiary designation completed and filed
     with the Committee before January 1, 1989, under the McDonald's
     Matching and Deferred Stock Ownership Plan shall be deemed to apply to
     the McDESOP portion of the Plan.  A beneficiary designation form filed
     with the Committee on or after January 1, 1989 shall be deemed to
     apply to the entire plan unless the form specifically states
     otherwise.  The Participant may change his Beneficiary designation and
     his elections concerning his Beneficiary's benefit from time to time
     by filing the beneficiary designation form with the Committee.  No
     designation of Beneficiary or election concerning a Beneficiary's
     benefit or change of such designation or election shall be effective
     until filed with the Committee.  If a Participant shall fail to file a
     valid Beneficiary designation, if all persons designated on the
     Beneficiary designation form predecease the Participant (or, in the
     case of a Beneficiary other than an individual, cease to exist prior
     to the Participant's death) or to the extent that the Participant's
     Beneficiary designation form fails to dispose of his entire interest,
     the Trustee shall distribute the Participant's vested Net Balance
     Account to the following persons in the following order of precedence:

               (a)  His surviving spouse;

               (b)  With respect to the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
          Plan, his Beneficiary designated under the McDonald's Matching
          and Deferred Stock Ownership Plan or the McDESOP portion of the
          Plan; and with respect to the McDESOP portion of the Plan, his
          Beneficiary designated under the McDonald's Corporation Savings
          and Profit Sharing Plan or the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
          Plan;

               (c)  The person or entity who receives the Participant's
          McDonald's group term life insurance benefits;

               (d)  His lawful descendants including adopted children per
          stripes;

               (e)  His parents in equal shares, or (if only one parent
          survives him) his surviving parent;

               (f)  The lawful descendants of his parents, per stripes;

               (g)  His estate.<PAGE>

     In the absence of a Participant's election to prohibit the Beneficiary
     elections allowed in Section 11.3(b), his Beneficiary shall be
     permitted to make such elections.

        11.7   Incompetency, Distribution of Benefits.

               (a)  If a Participant or Beneficiary is declared an
          incompetent or is a minor, and a conservator, guardian or other
          person legally charged with his care is appointed or if such
          Participant is not a minor and has executed a so-called durable
          power of attorney and if the Committee is given written notice of
          such appointment or power of attorney, any benefits to which such
          Participant or Beneficiary is entitled shall be distributable to
          such conservator, guardian or other person legally charged with
          his care or to the attorney-in-fact under the power of attorney.

               (b)  If a Participant or Beneficiary is incompetent, a minor
          or, in the opinion of the Committee, would fail to derive benefit
          from distribution of his accounts and if a conservator, guardian
          or other person legally charged with his care has not been
          appointed or if the Committee has not been given written notice
          of such appointment, the Committee may (1) require the
          appointment of a conservator or guardian, (2) distribute the
          Participant's Accounts to relatives of the Participant or
          Beneficiary for the benefit of the Participant or Beneficiary, or
          (3) distribute such Accounts directly to or for the benefit of
          the Participant or Beneficiary.

               (c)  The decision of the Committee in such matters shall be
          final, binding and conclusive upon the Employer and the Trustee
          and upon each Employee, Participant, Beneficiary and every other
          person or party interested or concerned, and neither the
          Employer, the Committee nor the Trustee shall be under any duty
          to see to the proper application of such distribution made to or
          for a Participant or Beneficiary, or conservator, guardian or
          relative of a Participant or Beneficiary.

        11.8   Deduction of Taxes from Accounts Payable.  The Trustee or
     the Committee may deduct from the amount to be distributed such amount
     as the Trustee or the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems proper
     to protect the Trustee, the Committee and the Trust against liability
     for the payment of death, succession, inheritance, income, or other
     taxes, and out of the money so deducted, the Trustee may discharge any
     such liability and pay the amount remaining to the Participant, the
     Beneficiary or the deceased Participant's estate, as the case may be.

        11.9   Deadline for Payment of Benefits.  Except to the extent that
     a Participant in accordance with the Plan otherwise elects and except
     to the extent it is not administratively feasible, payment of benefits
     shall be made or commence not later than sixty (60) days after the
     latest of (a) the close of the Plan Year in which the Participant
     attains age fifty-five (55), (b) the close of the Plan Year in which
     occurs the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Plan Year in which the
     Participant commenced participation, and (c) the close of the Plan
     Year in which the Participant has a Termination of Employment;
     provided that, a Participant, who is entitled to receive a
     distribution pursuant to this Section 11.9, must submit a claim for
     benefits before any distributions will be made hereunder.

        11.10  Spousal Consent to a Beneficiary or a Waiver.<PAGE>

               (a)  A valid spousal consent to the Participant's naming of
          a Beneficiary other than his spouse or to the Participant's
          Waiver of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualified
          Preretirement Survivor Annuity shall be:

                    (1)  in a writing acknowledging the effect of the
               consent;

                    (2)  witnessed by a notary public;

                    (3)  effective only with respect to a specific
               Beneficiary and, in the case of a waiver of a Qualified
               Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualified Preretirement
               Survivor Annuity, shall specify an optional form of benefit
               unless the spouse voluntarily in such consent expressly
               permits subsequent designations of beneficiaries or
               elections of optional forms of benefit without further
               spousal consent and acknowledges the spouse's right to limit
               the consent to a specific Beneficiary and optional form of
               benefit, where applicable; and

                    (4)  effective only for the spouse who exercises the
               consent;

          provided that notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XI,
          the consent of a Participant's spouse shall not be required if it
          is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that
          such consent may not be obtained because there is no spouse,
          because the spouse cannot be located or because of such other
          circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations
          prescribe.

               (b)  To the extent provided in any Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order (as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal
          Revenue Code), the former spouse of a Participant shall be
          treated as the surviving spouse of such Participant for purposes
          of Section 11.3 and for providing consent in accordance with
          Section 11.10(a).

        11.11  Single Sum Payment without Election.  Notwithstanding any
     provisions of this Article XI (except Section 11.14 to the extent
     therein provided) to the contrary, if the Participant or Beneficiary
     is entitled to a distribution because of the Participant's Break in
     Service (but not in the case of a Break in Service without a
     Termination of Employment), retirement on or after his Vesting
     Retirement Date, death, Disability, or other Termination of
     Employment, and if

               (a)  prior to July 1, 1993, the value of the vested portion
          of the Participant's Net Balance Account under the Plan; and

               (b)  effective on or after July 1, 1993, the value of the
          sum of (1) the vested portion of a Participant's Net Balance
          Account under the Plan and (2) his Accounts under the McDonald's
          Stock Sharing Plan

     does not exceed $3,500, the Committee shall direct the immediate
     distribution of such benefit prior to the annuity starting date or
     other date of distribution or commencement of distribution, regardless<PAGE>
     of any election or consent of the Participant, his spouse, or other
     Beneficiary.

        11.12  Installment Payments.  Notwithstanding anything in
     Sections 11.2 or 11.3 to the contrary and subject to Section 11.4:

               (a)  Elected Installments Paid to Participant.  If a
          Participant elects installment payments, they shall be
          substantially equal installments, paid at least annually, over a
          period certain as elected by the Participant which period shall
          not be in excess of the life expectancy of the Participant or the
          joint and last survivor life expectancy of the Participant and
          his Beneficiary, if such Beneficiary is an individual
          ("Applicable Life Expectancy") determined as of the date such
          payments commence; provided that if elected by the Participant
          pursuant to Section 11.12(e), life expectancy may be
          redetermined.

               (b)  Required Installments Paid to Participant.  The
          Applicable Life Expectancy of a Participant, who according to the
          records of the Employer has attained the age of 70-1/2 and who
          elects to receive installments but who fails to make a
          permissible election with respect to the period over which
          installments shall be paid or fails to provide the Committee with
          any requested proof of his age or the age of his Beneficiary by
          such deadline as the Committee shall require, shall be deemed to
          be the life expectancy of the Participant as reasonably
          determined from the records of the Employer; provided that if a
          Participant subsequently provides the Committee with proof that
          his age is greater than the Employer's records indicated, the
          Committee shall redetermine the Participant's Applicable Life
          Expectancy based upon the corrected information and shall
          distribute to the Participant any amounts which would have been
          required to be distributed if the Participant's correct age had
          been used to determine his Applicable Life expectancy for the
          purpose of determining the Minimum Distribution Amount for any
          installment distributions which have already been made.

               (c)  Installments Commencing After Participant's Death.  If
          installments commence to be paid after the Participant's death to
          the Participant's Beneficiary who is an individual, they shall be
          substantially equal installments, paid at least annually, over a
          period certain not in excess of the life expectancy of such
          individual ("Applicable Life Expectancy") determined as of the
          date such payments commence; provided that if the Participant's
          Beneficiary is his surviving spouse, such Beneficiary may elect
          to have his life expectancy redetermined as provided in
          Section 11.12(e).

               (d)  Minimum Distribution Amount.  Installment payments are
          substantially equal if the amount of each installment distributed
          in a calendar year is not less than an amount ("Minimum
          Distribution Amount") equal to the balance of the person's Net
          Balance Account as of the last day of the preceding calendar year
          divided by the Applicable Life Expectancy.  In calculating the
          Minimum Distribution Amount for each calendar year after the
          calendar year in which the Participant attained the age of 70-1/2
          or for each calendar year after payments to the Beneficiary have
          commenced (either of which is called the "First Year"), the<PAGE>
          Applicable Life Expectancy shall be reduced by one for each
          calendar year which has elapsed commencing with the First Year.

               (e)  Determination of Life Expectancy.  The life expectancy
          of a Participant and of his spouse and the joint and last
          survivor life expectancy of the Participant and his spouse may be
          redetermined for purposes of determining the amounts required to
          be distributed pursuant to Section 11.2(c), 11.2(d) or 11.12(a),
          if elected by the Participant (or his spouse, if the Participant
          is deceased and if his spouse is the Participant's Beneficiary)
          in accordance with such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as
          the Committee shall establish, but may not be redetermined more
          frequently than annually.  Life expectancies shall not be
          redetermined unless the Participant (or spouse) so elects by the
          date distributions are required to commence under the Plan.
          Unless subject to redetermination, life expectancies are
          calculated using the Participant's or Beneficiary's birth date in
          the calendar year in which the Participant attains the age of
          70-1/2, in the case of benefits commencing during the
          Participant's lifetime and in the case of payments to the
          Beneficiary, as of the date such payments commence.  In the case
          of annuity payments, however, life expectancy is determined in
          the calendar year in which annuity payments commence.  If a
          Participant's or his spouse's life expectancy is not being
          redetermined, it shall be reduced by one for each year after the
          calendar year in which it was determined for the purpose of
          determining the amount of installment payments hereunder.  All
          life expectancies shall be determined using the expected return
          multiples in Tables V and VI of Treas. Reg. Section 1.72-6 or any
          successor tables issued from time to time by the Internal Revenue
          Service.

        11.13  Required Minimum Distributions to Employed Participants.

               (a)  A Participant who has attained his Required Beginning
          Date but has not had a Termination of Employment shall commence
          receiving installment payments for the calendar year in which he
          becomes 70-1/2 not later than April 1 of the following year and
          installment payments for each calendar year after the calendar
          year in which he became 70-1/2, not later than the last day of
          each such year.

               (b)  The amount distributed for the year in which such
          Participant becomes 70-1/2 and in each calendar year thereafter
          shall be not less than the Minimum Distribution Amount determined
          under Section 11.12(a).

               (c)  A Participant who has not had a Termination of
          Employment and who expects to attain his Required Beginning Date
          in the next calendar year, may elect at such time and on such
          form as the Committee shall permit to receive his first
          distribution required pursuant to Section 11.13(a) in the year in
          which he becomes 70-1/2 years of age.

               (d)  If the vested Net Balance Account of a Participant who
          receives a distribution of the Minimum Distribution Amount under
          this Section 11.13 is $3500 or less, the Participant may elect to
          receive his entire vested Net Balance Account at the same time
          that such Minimum Distribution Amount is paid.  A Participant,
          who elects to receive his entire vested Net Balance Account<PAGE>
          pursuant to the preceding sentence, may elect to have such
          election apply each subsequent Plan Year until he changes the
          election with respect to a future Plan Year.  Effective
          November 1, 1994, the first sentence of this Section 11.13(d)
          shall be applied without regard to the requirement that the
          Participant's vested Net Balance Account be $3,500 or less.

        11.14  Transitional Rules.

               (a)  TEFRA 242(b) Elections.  Effective for all Participants
          and Beneficiaries whether or not the Participant was an Employee
          after the Effective Date of the Plan, notwithstanding any other
          provision herein, distributions to Participants or Beneficiaries
          made from the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Plan, except for
          the Participant's Diversification Account, are subject to any
          valid election under TEFRA Section 242(b) made under the
          McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing Plan by a
          Participant prior to January 1, 1984 to have the distribution of
          the Participant's benefits deferred or extended beyond the period
          otherwise permitted under the provisions of this Article XI which
          was then permitted under applicable law until the Participant (or
          his Beneficiary) revokes the election by an act recognized as a
          revocation under TEFRA 242(b); provided that if the Participant's
          spouse is not the Beneficiary of 100 percent of his vested
          Accrued Benefit under the Plan, the Participant's spouse shall
          have consented to the naming of another Beneficiary in accordance
          with Section 11.10.

               (b)  Distributions to Certain Participants and Beneficiaries
          in Pay Status.  Effective for all Participants and Beneficiaries
          whether or not the Participant was an Employee after January 1,
          1984, for any distribution which would not have disqualified the
          Trust under Code Section 401(a)(9) as in effect prior to
          amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, which was permitted
          under the Plan as in effect on the date such distributions
          commenced, and which either

                    (1)  commenced prior to and continued on or after
               January 1, 1984, distributions may continue to the
               Participant or the Beneficiary to whom such distribution is
               being made under the method of distribution in effect;
               provided that the method of distribution was specified in a
               writing including the time at which the distribution was to
               commence, the period over which such distributions will be
               made and, in the case of any distribution upon the
               Participant's death, a list of the Beneficiaries of the
               Participant in order or priority; or

                    (2)  commenced prior to the first Plan Year beginning
               in 1985, distributions may continue to the Participant or
               the Beneficiary to the extent permitted under applicable
               law, regulations and rulings.

        11.15  Sale of Restaurant - Special Vesting Rules.  Notwithstanding
     any of the provisions herein to the contrary, a Participant who is not
     100% vested in his Profit Sharing Fund Account and his Employer
     Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account and who has a Termination of
     Employment on account of a sale on or after December 1, 1986 but prior
     to January 1, 1993 of a McDonald's restaurant to a joint venture
     partnership in which the Company owns an interest ("Joint Venture")<PAGE>
     shall have a single opportunity to elect, in accordance with such
     procedures as the Committee shall establish, to receive a distribution
     of his benefits as provided in Article XI (or to retain the ability to
     make an election to receive such a distribution at any time) or
     (notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.11 to the contrary),
     solely for purposes of determining the Participant's Vested Percentage
     in his Profit Sharing Fund Account and his Employer Auxiliary ESOP
     Contribution Account, to continue to be credited with Credited Service
     for employment with the Joint Venture.  If the Participant elects to
     continue to be credited with Credited Service for employment with the
     Joint Venture, his Accounts will subsequently be distributed by
     applying Article XI as if the Joint Venture were his sole Employer for
     the purpose of determining when such Participant thereafter has a
     Termination of Employment.  Service for periods of employment with the
     Joint Venture shall be determined by crediting each such electing
     Participant with one Year of Credited Service for each subsequent
     consecutive October 31 that such Participant is employed by the Joint
     Venture; provided that a Participant shall not receive more than one
     Year of Credited Service for a single Plan Year.

        11.16  Withdrawal of Participant and Rollover Contributions
     Permitted.  A Participant may, upon written notice to the Committee,
     ten (10) days prior to the end of any calendar month, withdraw all or
     any portion of such Participant's Investment Savings Fund Account,
     Rollover Contribution Account and Rollover Contribution Holding
     Account valued as of the Valuation Date of the calendar month in which
     notice is given.  Distribution of such withdrawals shall be made
     within the next calendar month.  The Committee may, from time to time,
     establish such rules and procedures as it deems appropriate to
     administer or limit the withdrawal of Participant and Rollover
     Contributions under this Section 11.16 provided, however, that in no
     event shall the Committee limit a Participant's right of withdrawal to
     less than one withdrawal per Plan Year.  To the extent
     administratively feasible the period of notice required for withdrawal
     or distribution can be relaxed, reduced or eliminated upon appropriate
     request to the Committee.

        11.17  Direct Rollovers.  This Section 11.17 applies to
     distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.

               (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
          contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election
          under this Section 11.17, a Distributee may elect, at the time
          and in the manner prescribed by the Committee, to have any
          portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an
          Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct
          Rollover; subject to such reasonable administrative requirements
          as the Committee may from time to time establish which may
          include, but shall not be limited to, requirements consistent
          with Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued by the
          Internal Revenue Service permitting de minimis standards for
          amounts eligible to be rolled over or paid partly to the
          Participant and partly rolled over.  A Participant may make an
          election pursuant to this Section 11.17 only after the
          Distributee has met otherwise applicable requirements for receipt
          of a distribution under the Plan, including but not limited to
          any applicable requirements that the Participant's spouse or
          (pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as defined in
          Section 16.5) former spouse consent to the Participant's waiver<PAGE>
          of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualified
          Preretirement Survivor Annuity.

               If a Participant or Beneficiary elects to receive a Direct
          Rollover or a distribution in a form other than an annuity as
          provided in Section 11.2(a)(1)(C) or 11.3(a)(3)(C), such
          distribution may be made or commence to be made less than 30 days
          after the notice required under Section 1.411(a)-11(c) of the
          Income Tax Regulations is given, provided that:

                    (1)  the Committee shall clearly inform the Participant
               or Beneficiary that he has a right to a period of at least
               30 days after receiving the notice to consider the decision
               of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if
               applicable, a particular distribution option), and

                    (2)  the Participant or Beneficiary after receiving the
               notice affirmatively elects a distribution.

               (b)  In the absence of the adoption by the Committee of any
          requirements to the contrary, the following shall apply:

                    (1)  A Distributee whose Eligible Rollover Distribution
               is less than $200 upon the Valuation Date immediately
               preceding the date of distribution shall not be permitted to
               elect to have all or any portion of the distribution made in
               the form of a Direct Rollover.

                    (2)  A Distributee who elects a Direct Rollover in an
               amount equal to at least $500 may also elect to have the
               remaining portion of his distribution paid to the
               Distributee.

                    (3)  A Distributee shall be permitted to divide an
               Eligible Rollover Distribution into separate distributions
               to be paid to two or more Eligible Retirement Plans in two
               or more Direct Rollovers.

                    (4)  A Distributee's election to make or not to make a
               Direct Rollover with respect to a payment in a series of
               periodic payments shall apply to all subsequent payments in
               the series until the Distributee changes his election.

                    (5)  If a Distributee, who has been notified as to the
               availability of the Direct Rollover option, fails to elect a
               Direct Rollover with respect to an Eligible Rollover
               Distribution, such Distributee shall be deemed to have
               elected not to make a Direct Rollover.

               (c)  As used in this Section 11.17, the following terms
          shall have the following meanings:

                    (1)  "Eligible Rollover Distribution" means any
               distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
               credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover
               Distribution does not include:  any distribution that is one
               of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not
               less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
               expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint
               life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's<PAGE>
               designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten
               years or more; any distribution to the extent such
               distribution is required under Section 11.13; and the
               portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
               income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
               unrealized appreciation with respect to employer
               securities).

                    (2)  "Eligible Retirement Plan" means an individual
               retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the
               Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity
               described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an
               annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal
               Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in Section
               401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the
               Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distributions.  However, in
               the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to a
               Participant's surviving spouse or surviving former spouse
               who is a Distributee pursuant to a Qualified Domestic
               Relations Order, an Eligible Retirement Plan is an
               individual retirement account or individual retirement
               annuity.

                    (3)  "Distributee" means a Participant.  In addition, a
               Participant's surviving spouse and a former spouse who is
               the alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations
               Order are Distributees with regard to the interest of such
               spouse or former spouse.

                    (4)  "Direct Rollover" means a payment by the Plan to
               the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee.


                                  ARTICLE XII

                            SUBSIDIARY PARTICIPATION

        12.1   Adoption of Plan and Trust.  Any Commonly Controlled Entity,
     Subsidiary or Domestic or Foreign Affiliate of the Company (or other
     business entity in which the Company owns an interest) may, with the
     approval of the Board of Directors and under such terms and conditions
     as the Board of Directors may prescribe, adopt the Plan and Trust by
     resolution of its board of directors (or approval of other appropriate
     persons in the case of a noncorporate entity); provided that the
     Auxiliary ESOP portion of the Plan can be adopted only by a
     corporation which is a Commonly Controlled Entity or another
     corporation included with the Company in a group defined in (a) or (b)
     below:

               (a)  a corporation which is part of a group of corporations
          in which a common parent owns directly stock possessing at least
          50 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at
          least 50 percent of each class of non-voting stock in a first
          tier subsidiary and such subsidiary (and all other corporations
          below it in the chain) which would meet the 80 percent test of
          Section 1563(a) of the Code if the first tier subsidiary were the
          common parent); and

               (b)  a corporation which is part of a group of corporations
          in which a common parent owns directly stock possessing all of<PAGE>
          the voting power of all classes of stock and all of the
          non-voting stock in the first tier subsidiary and the first tier
          subsidiary owns directly stock possessing at least 50 percent of
          the voting power of all classes of stock, and at least 50 percent
          of each class of non-voting stock, in a second tier subsidiary of
          the common parent and such second tier subsidiary (and all other
          corporations below it in the chain which would meet the 80
          percent test of Section 1563(a) of the Code if the second tier
          subsidiary were a common parent).

        12.2   Withdrawal from Plan by Participating Employer.  While it is
     not the present intention of any Employer to withdraw from the Plan,
     any Employer other than the Company shall have the right, at any time,
     upon the approval of and under such conditions as may be provided by
     the Board of Directors, to withdraw from the Plan and Trust by
     delivering to the Committee and the Trustee written notice of its
     election so to withdraw.

          Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the Accounts of
     Participants employed by the withdrawing Employer as of the date of
     withdrawal shall be fully vested and shall not thereafter be subject
     to Forfeiture unless such Participant shall transfer to another
     Employer as of the date of the withdrawal.  In the event of the
     withdrawal of an Employer, such Employer shall elect and notify the
     Committee of its election, whether the Net Balance Accounts of the
     Participants employed by such Employer (a) shall be immediately
     distributable by the Trustee, (b) shall be retained in the Plan and
     become distributable when such employees die, or otherwise terminate
     their employment with the Employer, or (c) if the Employer establishes
     a plan which meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code
     which plan permits a transfer from this Plan to it by transfer of the
     Net Balance Accounts of Participants who are employees of such
     Employer to such Employer's plan to be held in separate accounts under
     such plan for the benefit of the respective Participants; provided
     that a distribution shall not be made to a Participant who is not
     otherwise entitled to a distribution in accordance with Article XI
     unless there has been a disposition of substantially all the assets
     used by the Employer in a trade or business and the Employee continues
     employment with the corporation acquiring such assets or the Company
     has disposed of its interest in the Employer and the Employee
     continues employment with the former Employer.


                                  ARTICLE XIII

                           ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

        13.1   Appointment and Removal of, and Resignation by, Trustee.
     The Board of Directors shall have the power to appoint a successor to
     a Trustee (including any one or more individuals acting as Trustee)
     which has resigned or been removed, to direct the Trustee to enter
     into a custodial agreement providing for deposit of all or any part of
     the Trust Fund with the custodian, and, with the consent of the
     Trustee, to appoint a co-Trustee.  The Trustee may resign at any time
     upon thirty (30) days' written notice (or such shorter period of time
     as the Board of Directors shall permit by written consent) to the
     Company and the Committee.  The Board of Directors shall have the
     power to remove the Trustee, with or without cause, upon written
     notice to the Trustee.<PAGE>

          The appointment of a successor Trustee or co-Trustee shall become
     effective upon acceptance in writing of such appointment by the
     successor Trustee or co-Trustee and upon acceptance of such
     appointment by the successor Trustee, the Trustee shall assign,
     transfer and pay over to the successor Trustee the Trust Fund.  The
     successor Trustee or co-Trustee may be either a corporate Trustee or
     an individual, and, except as required by federal law, the successor
     Trustee or co-Trustee shall not be personally liable for anything done
     or omitted to be done by a predecessor Trustee or co-Trustee prior to
     the appointment of the successor or co-Trustee or be required to
     examine the accounts, records or acts of any predecessor Trustee or
     co-Trustee.  Each successor Trustee appointed to and accepting a
     Trusteeship hereunder shall have all the rights, title, powers,
     duties, exemptions and limitations of the original Trustee.

        13.2   Appointment of Committee; Tenure in Office.  The
     administrative committee ("Committee") shall consist of not less than
     five (5) members who shall be appointed by the Board of Directors.
     The Board of Directors shall have power to determine the period during
     which any Committee member shall serve and, in its discretion, may
     remove any member of the Committee at any time without assigning any
     reason therefore.  A Committee member may resign at any time by
     written notice to the Chief Executive Officer or any Executive Vice
     President of the Company.  Upon a vacancy occurring, owing to the
     death, resignation or removal by the Board of Directors of any member
     of the Committee, a successor shall be appointed by the Board of
     Directors.  Until a vacancy in the Committee is filled by the Board of
     Directors, the remaining members of the Committee shall continue to
     act as the Committee.  The Board of Directors shall certify to the
     Trustee and the Committee the names of the members of the Committee
     and, thereafter, any change in its membership.

        13.3   Named Fiduciaries.  The Company, the Board of Directors, the
     Committee and every Participant, Beneficiary or Employee of the
     Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates who becomes a fiduciary by
     virtue of the delegation of duties, responsibilities and authority
     with respect to the administration and operation of the Plan in
     accordance with Article XIII shall be "named fiduciaries" as provided
     in Section 402(a) of ERISA, and shall, accordingly, be afforded the
     protection provided for in Section 405(c)(2) of ERISA with respect to
     named fiduciaries.

        13.4   Delegation of Responsibilities.  The Committee and the Board
     of Directors shall have the authority, as it may deem advisable, to
     delegate, from time to time, by instrument in writing all or any part
     of its responsibilities under the Plan (including the power to
     delegate) to such person or persons as it may deem suitable, and in
     the same manner to revoke any such delegation of responsibility.
     Periodically the delegate shall report to the Committee or Board of
     Directors concerning the discharge of his delegated responsibilities.
     Any action of the delegate in the exercise of such delegated
     responsibilities shall have the same force and effect for all purposes
     hereunder as if such action had been taken by the Committee or the
     Board of Directors.  Neither the Committee, the Board of Directors nor
     any of their members shall be liable for the acts or omissions of such
     delegate except as otherwise required by Federal law.

          The Committee's authority to delegate in accordance with this
     Section 13.4 shall include, but not be limited to, authority to
     delegate all or any part of the responsibilities set forth in<PAGE>
     Section 13.5 to any department or employee of the Company or other
     Employer including but not limited to the Legal Department, the Tax
     Department, the Accounting Department, the Human Resources Department,
     the Information Services Department or the Payroll Department.

        13.5   Committee Duties.  The Committee on behalf of the
     Participants and all other Beneficiaries of the Plan and the Trust
     shall administer and operate the Plan and the Trust Agreement in
     accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement and
     shall periodically report to the Board of Directors on the
     administration and operation of the Plan.  The Committee shall have
     all powers necessary to discharge its duties, including, but not by
     way of limitation, the following:

               (a)  To periodically review and monitor the performance of
          the Investment Managers, as defined in Section 4.4 of the Trust

          for the appointment or removal of the Plan's Investment Managers;

               (b)  To prepare and furnish to the Board of Directors its
          recommendations with respect to the establishment of and, from
          time to time, changes in the general investment objectives and
          guidelines for the management and investment of the assets of the
          Plan;

               (c)  To prepare and furnish the Board of Directors with
          periodic reports on the performance of the Investment Funds and
          the general administration of the Plan;

               (d)  To review and monitor the performance of the Trustee
          with respect to the responsibilities set forth in the Trust
          Agreements;

               (e)  To construe and interpret the Plan, decide all
          questions concerning eligibility for participation and questions
          relating to the amount and manner of payment of benefits
          hereunder and all such determinations shall be conclusive and
          binding upon Participants, spouses and other Beneficiaries;

               (f)  To receive from the Company and Employer or have
          prepared by the Company and Employer such records and information
          as shall be necessary for the proper administration of the Plan;

               (g)  To have prepared and furnished to Participants or
          Beneficiaries all information required under Federal law or
          provisions of this Plan to be furnished to them;

               (h)  To have prepared and filed or published with the
          Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury or other
          governmental agency all reports or other information required
          under federal law;

               (i)  To have maintained records of the Trust Fund with
          respect to the Net Balance Accounts of Participants;

               (j)  To determine all questions arising in the
          administration of the Plan, including those relating to the
          eligibility of persons to become Participants; the rights of
          Participants and their Beneficiaries; and Employer Contributions;<PAGE>


          and its decision thereon shall be final and binding upon all
          persons hereunder; and

               (k)  To review the performance of any person to whom duties
          and responsibilities have been delegated under Section 13.4.

        13.6   Committee Action by Majority -- Authorization of Members to
     Execute Documents.  The Committee may act at a meeting (including a
     telephonic meeting) by the consent of a majority of its members, or
     without a meeting by the unanimous written consent of its members.

          No member of the Committee shall vote or decide upon any matter
     relating specifically to himself or to his specific rights or benefits
     under the Plan.

          The Committee may authorize any of its members to execute on its
     behalf any document which reflects an action or decision of the
     Committee and the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
     names of its members so authorized.  Until the Committee revokes or
     alters such authorization by a written notice to the Trustee, the
     Trustee may accept and rely upon any document executed by such members
     as reflecting action by the Committee.

        13.7   Secretary.  The Committee shall appoint a Secretary (who
     may, but need not, be a member of the Committee) to keep records of
     the acts and resolutions of the Committee.  The Secretary may also
     perform such other duties which may, from time to time, be delegated
     to him in writing by the Committee.

        13.8   Member as Participant.  A member of the Committee who is
     also a Participant or a Beneficiary shall receive any benefit to which
     he may be entitled as a Participant or Beneficiary in the Plan so long
     as such benefit is computed and paid on a basis that is consistent
     with the terms of the Plan as applied to all other Participants and
     Beneficiaries.

        13.9   Rules and Decisions.  The Committee may, from time to time,
     adopt or amend such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or
     desirable which are consistent with the provisions or the purposes of
     the Plan.  All rules and decisions of the Committee shall be applied
     to all Participants in similar circumstances in a uniform and
     non-discriminatory manner.  In adopting, amending or applying its
     rules and regulations, the Committee shall be entitled to, but need
     not, rely upon information furnished by a Participant or Beneficiary,
     a delegate, an Employer or Employee, the Trustee or the Company.  All
     rules and regulations of the Committee shall be conclusive and binding
     upon Participants, spouses and Beneficiaries.

        13.10  Agents and Counsel.  The Committee and its delegates shall
     have the authority to appoint or employ individuals to assist or to
     advise in the administration of the Plan and any other agent deemed
     advisable, including but not limited to, independent certified public
     accountants and legal and actuarial counsel, who may but need not be
     the accountants or the legal or the actuarial counsel of the Company.

        13.11  Authorization of Benefit Distribution.  The Committee shall
     issue directions to the Trustee concerning all distributions to be

        13.12  Claims Procedure.

               (a)  Each Participant or Beneficiary (for purposes of this
          Section called a "Claimant") may submit his claim for benefits to
          the Plan Administrator in writing in such form as is permitted by
          the Committee.  A Claimant shall have no right to seek review of
          a denial of benefits, or to bring any action in any court to
          enforce a claim for benefits, prior to his filing a claim for
          benefits and exhausting his rights to review in accordance with
          this Section.

               When a claim for benefits has been filed properly, such
          claim for benefits shall be evaluated and the Claimant shall be
          notified of the approval or the denial within ninety (90) days
          after the receipt of such claim unless special circumstances
          require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If such
          an extension of time for processing is required, written notice
          of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the
          termination of the initial ninety (90) day period, and such
          notice shall specify the special circumstances requiring an
          extension and the date by which a final decision will be reached
          (which date shall not be later than one hundred and eighty (180)
          days after the date on which the claim was filed).  A Claimant
          shall be given a written notice in which he shall be advised as
          to whether the claim is granted or denied, in whole or in part.
          If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant shall be
          given written notice which shall contain (1) the specific reasons
          for the denial, (2) references to pertinent Plan provisions on
          which the denial is based, (3) a description of any additional
          material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an
          explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and
          (4) the Claimant's rights to seek review of the denial.

               (b)  If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant
          shall have the right to request that the Committee review the
          denial, provided that he files a written request for review with
          the Committee within sixty (60) days after the date on which he
          received written notification of the denial (or such longer
          period as the Committee for good cause may permit).  A Claimant
          (or his duly authorized representative) may review pertinent
          documents and submit issues and comments in writing to the
          Committee.  Within sixty (60) days after a request for review is
          received, the review shall be made and the Claimant shall be
          advised in writing of the decision on review, unless special
          circumstances require an extension of time for processing the
          review, in which case the Claimant shall, within such initial
          sixty (60) day period, be given a written notification specifying
          the reasons for the extension and when such review shall be
          completed (provided that such review shall be completed within
          one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date on which the
          request for review was filed).  The decision on review shall be
          forwarded to the Claimant in writing and shall include specific
          reasons for the decision and references to Plan provisions upon
          which the decision is based.  A decision on review shall be final
          and binding on all persons for all purposes.  If a Claimant shall
          fail to file a request for review in accordance with the
          procedures herein outlined, such Claimant shall have no rights to
          review and shall have no right to bring action in any court, and
          the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on all
          persons for all purposes.<PAGE>

        13.13  Information to be Furnished to Committee.  The Company and
     Employers shall furnish the Committee or its delegate such evidence,
     data and information as the Committee or its delegate may reasonably
     request.  Participants and their Beneficiaries shall also furnish to
     the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee or
     its delegate shall request.

        13.14  Plan Administrator.  The Committee may appoint a Plan
     Administrator who may (but need not) be a member of the Committee; and
     in the absence of such appointment, the Committee shall be the Plan
     Administrator.

        13.15  Fiduciary as Participant.  A fiduciary who is also a
     Participant or a Beneficiary shall receive any benefit to which he may
     be entitled as a Participant or Beneficiary in the Plan so long as
     such benefit is computed and paid on a basis that is consistent with
     the terms of the Plan as applied to all other Participants and
     Beneficiaries.

        13.16  Fiduciary Responsibility.  If a Plan fiduciary acts in
     accordance with ERISA, Title I, Subtitle B, Part 4:

               (a)  in determining that a Participant's spouse has
          consented to the naming of a Beneficiary other than the spouse,
          in relying on a Participant's election to waive a Qualified Joint
          and Survivor Annuity or a qualified survivor annuity or a
          revocation of such an election, or in determining that the
          consent of the Participant's spouse may not be obtained because
          there is no spouse, the spouse cannot be located or other
          circumstances prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury by
          regulations, then to the extent of payments made pursuant to such
          consent, revocation or determination, the Plan and its
          fiduciaries shall have no further liability;

               (b)  in treating a domestic relations order as being (or not
          being) a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, or, during any
          period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order
          is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is being determined (by
          the Committee, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
          otherwise), in segregating in a separate account in the Plan or
          in an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable to
          the alternate payee during such period if the order had been
          determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, in paying
          the amounts segregated or held in escrow to the person entitled
          thereto if within 18 months the domestic relations order (or a
          modification thereof) is determined to be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order, in paying such amounts to the person entitled
          thereto if there had been no order, if within 18 months the
          domestic relations order is determined not to be qualified or if
          the issue is not resolved within 18 months and in prospectively
          applying a domestic relations order which is determined to be
          qualified after the close of the 18-month period, then the
          obligation of the Plan and its fiduciaries to the Participant and
          each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any
          payment made pursuant to such acts.


                                  ARTICLE XIV<PAGE>

            AMENDMENT, TERMINATION, MERGER AND CONSOLIDATION OF PLAN

        14.1   Amendment.  The Board of Directors shall have the right, at
     any time and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or
     all of the provisions of the Plan and the Trust Agreement, provided
     that no amendment shall authorize or permit any part of the Trust Fund
     to be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive
     benefit of the Participants or their beneficiaries, or permit any
     portion of the Trust Fund to revert to or become the property of any
     Employer, except as may be permitted under applicable law, regulations
     and rulings.  No amendment shall deprive any Participant or any
     Beneficiary of a deceased Participant of any of the benefits or of an
     optional form of benefit to which he is entitled under this Plan with
     respect to contributions previously made or, except to the extent
     permitted in regulations and rulings issued by the Secretary of the
     Treasury, shall eliminate an optional form of benefit with respect to
     contributions previously made, nor shall any amendment decrease any
     Participant's Accounts provided that no amendment made in conformance
     to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or any other statute
     relating to employee's trusts, or any official regulations or rulings
     issued pursuant thereto, shall be considered prejudicial to the rights
     of any Participant or Beneficiary.  No amendment which affects the
     rights, duties or responsibilities of the Trustee may be made without
     the Trustee's written consent.

          The Committee shall have the same authority with respect to the
     adoption of amendments to the Plan and the Trust Agreement as the
     Board of Directors in the following circumstances:

               (a)  to adopt amendments to the Plan or Trust which the
          Committee determines are necessary or desirable for the Plan to
          comply with or to obtain benefits or advantages under the
          provisions of applicable law, regulations or rulings or
          requirements of the Internal Revenue Service or other government
          administrative agency or of changes in such law, regulations,
          rulings or requirements; and

               (b)  to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic amendment
          that the Committee determines to be necessary or desirable that
          does not materially change benefits to Participants or their
          Beneficiaries or materially increase the Employers' contributions
          to the Plan.

          The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by the
     Committee to the Board of Directors on a timely basis.

        14.2   Termination of Plan By the Company.  Although it is the
     intention of the Company that this Plan be permanent, the Company
     reserves the right to terminate the Plan and the Trust at any time, by
     delivering to the Committee, the Trustee and each Employer hereunder,
     written notice of termination.

          Upon termination of the Plan or permanent discontinuance of
     Employer Contributions to the Plan, the interest in his Net Balance
     Account of each Participant who is an Employee at the time of the
     termination, shall become fully vested.  Such vested Accounts, shall,
     however, be subject to readjustment as provided in Sections 10.14,
     10.15, 10.16, 10.17 and 10.19.  In the event of termination of this
     Plan, the Board of Directors may direct that the Trustee continue the
     Trust for a specified period of time, or for such period of time, as<PAGE>
     the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may deem to be in the best
     interest of the Participants or their Beneficiaries.  In the absence
     of specific direction from the Board of Directors, the Trust assets
     shall be distributed by the Trustee to Participants under the options
     set forth in Section 11.2 hereof or to Beneficiaries under the options
     set forth in Section 11.3; provided, however, that Participant Elected
     Contributions shall be distributed only if (a) the Participant has a
     Termination of Employment, death or Disability, or has attained the
     age of 59-1/2, (b) the Plan is terminated without the Employer's
     establishment or maintenance of another defined contribution plan
     (excluding a leveraged ESOP as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(7)) or
     (c) the Employer disposes of substantially all of its assets used in a
     trade or business or disposes of its interest in a subsidiary and the
     Employee continues employment with the corporation acquiring the
     assets or the subsidiary and if, in the case of a distribution made
     pursuant to Section 14.2(b) or (c) the distribution is made in the
     form of a single distribution of the entire balance to the credit of
     the Participant in a single taxable year.  Upon the partial
     termination of the Plan the interest of each Participant whose
     employment is terminated on account of, or who is affected by, such
     partial termination shall become fully vested and such Participant's
     benefits shall be distributable to the extent permitted in the
     preceding sentence.  Sales of McDonald's Restaurants by the Company or
     another Employer will not constitute a partial termination unless such
     sale under all other facts and circumstances constitutes a partial
     termination.

        14.3   Merger, Consolidation, or Transfer of Assets.  This Plan
     shall not be merged or consolidated with, nor shall any assets or
     liabilities be transferred to, any other plan, unless the benefits
     payable to each Participant if the Plan were terminated immediately
     after such action would not be less than the benefits which would have
     been payable to each such Participant if the Plan had been terminated
     immediately before such action.

        14.4   Transfer of Assets from Plans of Subsidiaries.  The Board of
     Directors may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, authorize and
     direct the transfer to the Trust of all (or any designated portion) of
     the assets of any defined contribution plan (the "Transferred Assets")
     which is a Related Plan.  The Transferred Assets, to the extent
     allocable to persons who are Participants in the Plan, shall be held,
     managed and distributed for the benefit of participants of the Related
     Plan (the "Transferred Assets") subject to such terms and conditions
     as the Board of Directors and the board of directors (or persons
     having authority similar to the board of directors of a corporation)
     of the Commonly Controlled Entity, if applicable, of the Company shall
     provide.

               (a)  The Trustee shall accept, under such terms and
          conditions as the Board of Directors shall provide for, all
          Transferred Assets.

               (b)  Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Board of
          Directors and the board of directors (or persons having authority
          similar to the board of directors of a corporation) of the
          Commonly Controlled Entity, if applicable, all Participants'
          interests in the Transferred Assets shall be 100 percent (100%)
          vested and non-forfeitable.<PAGE>

               (c)  The Committee shall keep separate records of account
          for each Participant's interests in the Transferred Assets.

               (d)  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
          Transferred Assets shall be held, managed, invested and
          distributed in the same manner (and subject to the same
          restrictions) as Rollover Contributions, as provided in
          Article VIII of the Plan.

               (e)  Each Participant's Transferred Assets shall be
          distributable in the same manner as a Participant's Rollover
          Contribution Account; provided that the Participant can also
          elect any benefit option which was available with respect to the
          Transferred Assets under the Related Plan.


                                   ARTICLE XV

                              TOP HEAVY PROVISIONS

        15.1   Application.  The definitions in Section 15.2 shall apply
     under this Article XV and the special rules in Section 15.3 shall
     apply, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, for any Plan
     Year in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan and for such other Plan
     Years as may be specified herein.  Anything in this Article XV to the
     contrary notwithstanding, if the Plan is a multiple employer plan as
     described in Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c), the provisions of
     this Article XV shall be applied separately to each Employer (together
     with the businesses which with that Employer are Commonly Controlled
     Entities or members of an Affiliated Service Group) taking account of
     benefits under the plan provided to employees of the Employer,
     Commonly Controlled Entity or members of an Affiliated Service Group
     because of service with that Employer or Commonly Controlled Entity.

        15.2   Special Top Heavy Definitions.  The following special
     definitions shall apply under this Article XV.

               (a)  "Aggregate Employer Contributions" means the sum of all
          Employer Contributions and Forfeitures under this Plan allocated
          for a Participant to the Plan and employer contributions and
          forfeitures allocated for the Participant to all Related Defined
          Contribution Plans in the Aggregation Group; provided, however,
          that for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 1985, employer
          contributions attributable to salary reduction or similar
          arrangement under the Plan shall not be included in Aggregate
          Employer Contributions and provided further that, for Plan Years
          which begin after December 31, 1988, Participant Elected
          Contributions, Employer Matching Contributions and Special
          Section 401(k) Contributions shall not be included for Non-Key
          Employees.

               (b)  "Aggregation Group" means the group of plans in a
          Mandatory Aggregation Group, if any, that includes the Plan,
          unless inclusion of Related Plans in the Permissive Aggregation
          Group in the Aggregation Group would prevent the Plan from being
          a Top Heavy Plan, in which case "Aggregation Group" means the
          group of plans consisting of the Plan and each other Related Plan
          in a Permissive Aggregation Group with the Plan.<PAGE>

                    (1)  "Mandatory Aggregation Group" means each plan
               (considering the Plan and Related Plans) that, during the
               Plan Year that contains the Determination Date or any of the
               four preceding Plan Years,

                         (A)  had a participant who was a Key Employee, or

                         (B)  was necessary to be considered with a plan in
                    which a Key Employee participated in order to enable
                    the plan in which the Key Employee participated to meet
                    the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410
                    of the Internal Revenue Code.

               If the Plan is not described in (A) or (B) above, it shall
               not be part of a Mandatory Aggregation Group.

                    (2)  "Permissive Aggregation Group" means the group of
               plans consisting of (A) the plans, if any, in a Mandatory
               Aggregation Group with the Plan, and (B) any other Related
               Plan, that, when considered as a part of the Aggregation
               Group, does not cause the Aggregation Group to fail to
               satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and
               Section 410 of the Internal Revenue Code.  A Related Plan in
               (B) of the preceding sentence may include a simplified
               employee pension plan, as defined in Internal Revenue Code
               Section 408(k), and a collectively bargained plan, if when
               considered as a part of the Aggregation Group such plan does
               not cause the Aggregation Group to fail to satisfy the
               requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410 of the
               Internal Revenue Code considering, if the plan is a multiple
               employer plan as described in Internal Revenue Code Section
               413(c), benefits under the plan only to the extent provided
               to employees of the employer because of service with the
               employer and, if the plan is a simplified employee pension
               plan, only the employer's contribution to the plan.

               (c)  "Determination Date" means, with respect to a Plan
          Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year or, in the case of
          the first Plan Year, the last day of such Plan Year.  If the Plan
          is aggregated with other plans in the Aggregation Group, the
          Determination Date for each other plan shall be, with respect to
          any Plan Year, the Determination Date for each such other plan
          which falls in the same calendar year as the Determination Date
          for the Plan.

               (d)  "Key Employee" means, for the Plan Year containing the
          Determination Date, any person or the beneficiary of any person
          who is an employee or former employee of an Employer, a Commonly
          Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group as
          determined under Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i) and who, at
          any time during the Plan Year containing the Determination Date
          or any of the four (4) preceding Plan Years (the "Measurement
          Period"), is a person described in paragraph (1), (2), (3) or
          (4), subject to paragraph (5).

                    (1)  An officer of the Employer, Commonly Controlled
               Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group who:

                         (A)  in any Measurement Period, in the case of a
                    Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1983, is an<PAGE>
                    officer during the Plan Year and has annual Considered
                    Compensation for the Plan Year in an amount greater
                    than fifty percent (50%) of the amount in effect under
                    Section 415(b)(1)(A) of Internal Revenue Code for the
                    calendar year in which such Plan Year ends ($112,221 in
                    1992, adjusted in subsequent years as determined in
                    accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
                    of the Treasury or his delegate pursuant to the
                    provisions of Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue
                    Code); and

                         (B)  in any Measurement Period, in the case of a
                    Plan Year beginning before January 1, 1984, is an
                    officer during the Plan Year, regardless of his
                    Considered Compensation (except to the extent that
                    applicable law, regulations and rulings indicate that
                    the compensation requirement set forth in subparagraph
                    (A) above is applicable).

               No more than a total of fifty (50) persons (or, if lesser,
               the greater of three (3) persons or ten percent (10%) of all
               persons or beneficiaries of persons who are employees or
               former employees) shall be treated as Key Employees under
               this paragraph (1) for any Measurement Period.  In the case
               of an Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
               Affiliated Service Group which is not a corporation (I) in
               any Measurement Period, in the case of a Plan Year beginning
               on or before February 28, 1985 no persons shall be treated
               as Key Employees under this paragraph (1); and (II) in any
               Measurement Period, in the case of a Plan Year beginning
               after February 28, 1985, the term "officer" as used in this
               subsection (d) shall include administrative executives as
               described in Section 1.416-1(T-13) of the Treasury
               Regulations.

                    (2)  One (1) of the ten (10) persons who, during a Plan
               Year in the Measurement Period:

                         (A)  have annual Considered Compensation from the
                    Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
                    Affiliated Service Group for such Plan Year greater
                    than the amount in effect under Section 415(c)(1)(A) of
                    the Internal Revenue Code for the calendar year in
                    which such Plan Year ends (the greater of $30,000 for
                    1992 or one-fourth of the dollar limitation in effect
                    under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue
                    Code, adjusted in subsequent years as determined in
                    accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
                    of the Treasury or his delegate pursuant to the
                    provisions of Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue
                    Code); and

                         (B)  own (or are considered as owning within the
                    meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) in such
                    Plan Year, the largest percentage interests in the
                    Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
                    Affiliated Service Group, in such Plan Year, provided
                    that no person shall be treated as a Key Employee under
                    this paragraph unless he owns more than one-half
                    percent (1/2%) interest in the Employer, Commonly<PAGE>
                    Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service
                    Group.

               No more than a total of ten (10) persons or beneficiaries of
               persons who are employees or former employees shall be
               treated as Key Employees under this paragraph (2) for any
               Measurement Period.

                    (3)  A person who, for a Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, is a more than five percent (5%) owner (or is
               considered as owning more than five percent (5%) within the
               meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) of the
               Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
               Affiliated Service Group.

                    (4)  A person who, for a Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, is a more than one percent (1%) owner (or is
               considered as owning more than one percent (1%) within the
               meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) of the
               Employer, a Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
               Affiliated Service Group and has an annual Considered
               Compensation for such Plan Year from the Employer, Commonly
               Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group
               of more than $150,000.

                    (5)  If the number of persons who meet the requirements
               to be treated as Key Employees under paragraph (1) or (2)
               exceed the limitation on the number of Key Employees to be
               counted under paragraph (1) or (2), those persons with the
               highest annual Considered Compensation in a Plan Year in the
               Measurement Period for which the requirements are met and
               who are within the limitation on the number of Key Employees
               will be treated as Key Employees.

               If the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) are met by a
               person in more than one (1) Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, each person will be counted only once under
               paragraph (1) or (2):

                         (A)  under paragraph (1), the Plan Year in the
                    Measurement Period in which a person who was an officer
                    and had the highest annual Considered Compensation
                    shall be used to determine whether the person will be
                    treated as a Key Employee under the preceding sentence;

                         (B)  under paragraph (2), the Plan Year in the
                    Measurement Period in which the ownership percentage
                    interest is the greatest shall be used to determine
                    whether the person will be treated as a Key Employee
                    under the preceding sentence.

               Notwithstanding the above provisions of paragraph (5), a
               person may be counted in determining the limitation under
               both paragraphs (1) and (2).  In determining the sum of the
               Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key Employees under
               subsection (h) of this Section, the Present Value of Accrued
               Benefits for any person shall be counted only once.

               (e)  "Non-Key Employee" means (1) a person or the
          beneficiary of a person with an account balance in the Plan or an<PAGE>
          account balance or accrued benefit in any Related Plan in the
          Aggregation Group or (2) an employee, a former employee or the
          beneficiary of such person who has received a distribution during
          the Measurement Period and (3) who during the Measurement Period
          is not a Key Employee.

               (f)  "Present Value of Accrued Benefits" means, for any Plan
          Year, an amount equal to the sum of (1), (2) and (3) for each
          person who, in the Plan Year containing the Determination Date,
          was a Key Employee or a Non-Key Employee.

                    (1)  Subject to (4) below, the value of a person's Net
               Balance Account under the Plan and his accrued benefit under
               each Related Defined Contribution Plan in the Aggregation
               Group, determined as of the valuation date coincident with
               or immediately preceding the Determination Date, adjusted
               for contributions due as of the Determination Date, as
               follows:

                         (A)  in the case of a plan not subject to the
                    minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the
                    Internal Revenue Code, by including the amount of any
                    contributions actually made after the valuation date
                    but on or before the Determination Date, and, in the
                    first plan year of a plan, by including contributions
                    made after the Determination Date that are allocated as
                    of a date in that first plan year; and

                         (B)  in the case of a plan that is subject to the
                    minimum funding requirements, by including the amount
                    of any contributions that would be allocated as of a
                    date not later than the Determination Date, plus
                    adjustments to those amounts as required under
                    applicable rulings, even though those amounts are not
                    yet required to be contributed or allocated (e.g.,
                    because they have been waived) and by including the
                    amount of any contributions actually made (or due to be
                    made) after the valuation date but before the
                    expiration of the extended payment period in
                    Section 412(c)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.

                    (2)  Subject to (4) below, the sum of the actuarial
               present values of a person's accrued benefits under each
               Related Defined Benefit Plan in the Aggregation Group,
               expressed as a benefit commencing at Vesting Retirement Date
               (or the person's attained age, if later) determined based on
               the following actuarial assumptions:

                         (A)  Interest rate 5%; and

                         (B)  Post Retirement Mortality: 1984 Unisex
                    Pension Table;

               and determined in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
               Section 416(g), provided, however, that if a defined benefit
               plan in the Aggregation Group provides for different or
               additional actuarial assumptions to be used in determining
               the present value of accrued benefits thereunder for the
               purpose of determining the top heavy status thereof, then
               such different or additional actuarial assumptions shall<PAGE>
               apply with respect to each defined benefit plan in the
               Aggregation Group, and further provided that the accrued
               benefit of any Non-Key Employee shall be determined under
               the method which is used for accrual purposes for all
               Related Defined Benefit Plans or, if no single accrual
               method is used in all such plans, such accrued benefit shall
               be determined as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly
               than the slowest accrual rate permitted under Section
               411(b)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.

               The present value of an accrued benefit for any person who
               is employed by an employer maintaining a plan on the
               Determination Date is determined as of the most recent
               valuation date which is within a 12-month period ending on
               the Determination Date, provided however that:

                         (C)  for the first plan year of the plan, the
                    present value for an employee is determined as if the
                    employee had a Termination of Employment (i) on the
                    Determination Date or (ii) on such valuation date but
                    taking into account the estimated accrued benefit as of
                    the Determination Date; and

                         (D)  for the second and subsequent plan years of
                    the plan, the accrued benefit taken into account for an
                    employee is not less than the accrued benefit taken
                    into account for the first plan year unless the
                    difference is attributable to using an estimate of the
                    accrued benefit as of the Determination Date for the
                    first plan year and using the actual accrued benefit as
                    of the Determination Date for the second plan year.

               For purposes of this paragraph (2), the valuation date is
               the valuation date used by the plan for computing plan costs
               for minimum funding, regardless of whether a valuation is
               performed that year.

                    If the plan provides for a nonproportional subsidy as
               described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.416-1 (T-27),
               the present value of accrued benefits shall be determined
               taking into account the value of nonproportional subsidized
               early retirement benefits and nonproportional subsidized
               benefit options.

                    (3)  Subject to (4) below, the aggregate value of
               amounts distributed during the plan year that includes the
               Determination Date or any of the four preceding plan years
               including amounts distributed under a terminated plan which,
               if it had not been terminated, would have been in the
               Aggregation Group.

                    (4)  The following rules shall apply in determining the
               Present Value of Accrued Benefits:

                         (A)  Amounts attributable to qualified voluntary
                    employee contributions, as defined in Section 219(e) of
                    the Internal Revenue Code, shall be excluded.

                         (B)  In computing the Present Value of Accrued
                    Benefits with respect to rollovers or plan-to-plan<PAGE>
                    transfers, the following rules shall be applied to
                    determine whether amounts which have been distributed
                    during the five (5) year period ending on the
                    Determination Date from or accepted into this Plan or
                    any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be included in
                    determining the Present Value of Accrued Benefits:

                              (i)  Unrelated Transfers accepted into the
                         Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group after
                         December 31, 1983 shall not be included.

                              (ii) Unrelated Transfers accepted on or
                         before December 31, 1983 and all Related Transfers
                         accepted at any time into the Plan or any plan in
                         the Aggregation Group shall be included.

                              (iii)     Unrelated Transfers made from the
                         Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be
                         included.

                              (iv) Related Transfers made from the Plan or
                         any plan in the Aggregation Group shall not be
                         included by the transferor plan (but shall be
                         counted by the accepting plan).

               The accrued benefit of any individual who has not performed
          services for an Employer maintaining the Plan at any time during
          the five (5) year period ending on the Determination Date shall
          be excluded in computing the Present Value of Accrued Benefits.

               (g)  "Related Transfer" means a rollover or a plan-to-plan
          transfer which is either not initiated by the Employee or is made
          between plans each of which is maintained by a Commonly
          Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group.

               (h)  A "Top Heavy Aggregation Group" means an Aggregation
          Group in any Plan Year for which, as of the Determination Date,
          the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key
          Employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group exceeds sixty
          percent (60%) of the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits
          for all employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group;
          provided that, for purposes of determining the sum of Present
          Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees, former Key Employees
          who have not performed any services for an Employer, a Commonly
          Controlled Entity or a member of an Affiliated Service Group in
          the Plan Year containing the Determination Date or the preceding
          four Plan Years shall be excluded entirely from the calculation
          of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for the Plan Year that
          contains the Determination Date.  For purposes of applying the
          special rules herein with respect to a Super Top Heavy Plan, a
          Top Heavy Aggregation Group will also constitute a "Super Top
          Heavy Aggregation Group" if in any Plan Year as of the
          Determination Date, the sum of the Present Value of Accrued
          Benefits for Key Employees under all plans in the Aggregation
          Group exceeds ninety percent (90%) of the sum of the Present
          Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees under all plans in
          the Aggregation Group.

               (i)  "Top Heavy Plan" means the Plan in any Plan Year in
          which it is a member of a Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including<PAGE>
          a Top Heavy Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Plan.  For
          purposes of applying the rules herein with respect to a Super Top
          Heavy Plan, a Top Heavy Plan will also constitute a "Super Top
          Heavy Plan" if the Plan in any Plan Year is a member of a Super
          Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including a Super Top Heavy
          Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Plan.

               (j)  "Unrelated Transfer" means a rollover or a plan-to-plan
          transfer which is both initiated by the Employee and (1) made
          from a plan maintained by a Commonly Controlled Entity or member
          of an Affiliated Service Group to a plan maintained by an
          employer which is not a Commonly Controlled Entity or member of
          an Affiliated Service Group or (2) made to a plan maintained by a
          Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service
          Group from a plan maintained by an employer which is not a
          Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service
          Group.

        15.3   Special Top Heavy Provisions.  For each Plan Year in which
     the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan, the following rules shall apply, except
     that the special provisions of this Section 15.3 shall not apply with
     respect to any employee included in a unit of employees covered by an
     agreement which the Secretary of Labor finds to be a
     collective-bargaining agreement between employee representatives and
     one or more employers if there is evidence that retirement benefits
     were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee
     representative and the Employer or Employers:

               (a)  Minimum Employer Contributions.  In any Plan Year in
          which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan, the Employers shall make
          additional Employer Contributions to the Plan as necessary for
          each Participant who is employed on the last day of the Plan Year
          and who is a Non-Key Employee to bring the amount of his
          Aggregate Employer Contributions for the Plan Year up to at least
          three percent (3%) of his Considered Compensation, or such lesser
          amount as is equal to the largest percentage of a Key Employee's
          Considered Compensation allocated to the Key Employee as
          Aggregate Employer Contributions.

          For purposes of determining whether a Non-Key Employee is a
          Participant entitled to have minimum Employer Contributions made
          on his behalf, a Non-Key Employee will be treated as a
          Participant even if he is not otherwise a Participant (or accrues
          no benefit) under the Plan because:

                    (1)  he has failed to complete the requisite number of
               hours of service (if any) after becoming a Participant in
               the Plan,

                    (2)  he is excluded from participation in the Plan (or
               accrues no benefit) merely because his compensation is less
               than a stated amount, or

                    (3)  he is excluded from participation in the Plan (or
               accrues no benefit) merely because of a failure to make
               mandatory employee contributions or because of a failure to
               make elective 401(k) contributions.

               (b)  Vesting.  For each Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top
          Heavy Plan and for each Plan Year thereafter, the vested right of<PAGE>
          each Participant who has an Hour of Service after the Plan
          becomes a Top Heavy Plan to a percentage of his Profit Sharing
          Fund Account and Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account (to
          the extent such Accounts had not been forfeited prior to the
          Plan's becoming a Top Heavy Plan) shall be determined under the
          following table:

               Year of Credited Service      Vested Percentage
               ------------------------      -----------------
               Less than 2                        0%
               2 but less than 3                  20
               3 but less than 4                  40
               4 but less than 5                  60
               5 but less than 6                  80
               6 or more                          100

               (c)  Limitations.  In computing the limitations under
          Article IX hereof for years in which the Plan is a Top Heavy
          Plan, the special rules of Section 416(h) of the Code shall be
          applied in accordance with applicable regulations and rulings so
          that, in determining the denominator of the defined contribution
          plan fraction, as defined in Section 415(e)(3) of the Internal
          Revenue Code ("Defined Contribution Plan Fraction") and the
          defined benefit plan fraction as defined in Section 415(e)(2) of
          the Internal Revenue Code ("Defined Benefit Plan Fraction") at
          each place at which "1.25" would have been used, "1.00" shall be
          substituted and by substituting $41,500 for $51,875 in the
          numerator of the transition fraction described in Section
          415(e)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless the Plan is not
          a Super Top Heavy Plan and the special requirements of Section
          416(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code have been satisfied.

               (d)  Transition Rule for a Top Heavy Plan.  Notwithstanding
          the provisions of Section 15.3(c), for each Plan Year in which
          the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan and in which the Plan does not meet
          the special requirements of Section 416(h)(2) of the Internal
          Revenue Code in order to use 1.25 in the denominator of the
          Defined Contribution Plan Fraction and the Defined Benefit Plan
          Fraction, if an Employee was a participant in one or more defined
          benefit plans and in one or more defined contribution plans
          maintained by the Employer before the plans became Top Heavy
          Plans and if such Participant's Combined Fraction exceeds 1.00
          because of accruals and additions that were made before the plans
          became Top Heavy Plans, a factor equal to the lesser of 1.25 or
          such lesser amount (but not less than 1.00) as shall be needed to
          make the Employee's Combined Fraction equal to 1.00 shall be used
          in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the
          Defined Contribution Plan Fraction if there are no further
          accruals or annual additions under any Top Heavy Plans until the
          Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater than 1.00 when a
          factor of 1.00 is used in the denominators of the Defined Benefit
          Plan Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction.  Any
          provisions herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Plan is
          a Top Heavy Plan and the Plan does not meet the special
          requirements of Section 416(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code in
          order to use 1.25 in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan
          Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction, there shall
          be no further Annual Additions for a Participant whose Combined
          Fraction is greater than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used in
          the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the<PAGE>
          Defined Contribution Plan Fraction, until such time as the
          Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater than 1.00.

               (e)  Transition Rule for a Super Top Heavy Plan.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.3(c) and 15.3(d),
          for each Plan Year in which the Plan is a Super Top Heavy Plan,
          (1) if an Employee was a participant in one or more defined
          benefit plans and in one or more defined contribution plans
          maintained by the employer before the plans became Super Top
          Heavy Plans, and (2) if such Participant's Combined Fraction
          exceeds 1.00 because of accruals and additions that were made
          before the plans became Super Top Heavy Plans and if immediately
          before the plans became Super Top Heavy Plans the Combined
          Fraction as then computed did not exceed 1.00, then a factor
          equal to the lesser of 1.25 or such lesser amount (but not less
          than 1.00) as shall be needed to make the Employee's Combined
          Fraction equal to 1.00 shall be used in the denominator of the
          Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan
          Fraction if there are no further accruals or annual additions
          under any Super Top Heavy Plans until the Participant's Combined
          Fraction is not greater than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used
          in the denominators of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the
          Defined Contribution Plan Fraction.  Any provisions herein to the
          contrary notwithstanding, if the Plan is a Super Top Heavy Plan,
          there shall be no further Annual Additions for a Participant
          whose Combined Fraction is greater than 1.00 when a factor of
          1.00 is used in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan
          Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction until the
          Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater than 1.00.

               (f)  Terminated Plan.  If the Plan becomes a Top Heavy Plan
          after it has formally been terminated, has ceased crediting for
          benefit accruals and vesting and has been or is distributing all
          plan assets to participants and their beneficiaries as soon as
          administratively feasible or if a terminated plan has distributed
          all benefits of participants and their beneficiaries, the
          provisions of Section 15.3 shall not apply to the Plan.

               (g)  Frozen Plans.  If the Plan becomes a Top Heavy Plan
          after contributions have ceased under the Plan but all assets
          have not been distributed to participants or their beneficiaries,
          the provisions of Section 15.3 shall apply to the Plan.


                                  ARTICLE XVI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        16.1   Headings.  Headings of sections and subsections of the Plan
     are inserted for convenience of reference and are neither part of the
     Plan nor to be considered in the construction thereof.

        16.2   Indemnification.  Each member of the Committee, each member
     of the Board of Directors, each individual serving as Trustee without
     compensation, and each and every Employee to whom are delegated
     duties, responsibilities and authority with respect to the Plan and
     the Trust shall be indemnified, held harmless and promptly reimbursed
     by the Company against all claims, liabilities, fines and penalties
     and all expenses (including, but not limited to, attorney fees)
     reasonably incurred by or imposed upon such member, individual or<PAGE>


     Employee which arise as a result of his actions or failure to act in
     connection with the operation and administration of the Plan and the
     Trust, to the extent lawfully allowable; provided that to the extent
     that such claim, liability, fine, penalty or expense is paid for by
     liability insurance purchased by or paid for by the Company,
     reimbursement shall be limited to amounts which would not cause the
     loss of coverage under such insurance and further provided that to the
     extent that the Company has reimbursed the Employee, the Company shall
     be subrogated to the Trustee's rights to reimbursement under such
     insurance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
     indemnify any person for any such amount incurred through any
     settlement or compromise of any action unless the Company consents in
     writing to such settlement or compromise.  Expenses incurred in
     defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid
     by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action,
     suit or proceeding as authorized by the Company in the specific case
     upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the member of the
     Committee, member of the Board of Directors, individual Trustee or
     Employee to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined
     that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized in
     this Section 16.2.

        16.3   Employees' Trust.  This Plan is created for the exclusive
     purpose of providing benefits to the Participants in the Plan and
     their Beneficiaries, and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
     with its being a Plan described in Section 401(a) of the Internal
     Revenue Code and with the Trust's being a Trust exempt under Section
     501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

        16.4   Nonalienation of Benefits.

               (a)  Benefits payable under this Plan shall not be subject
          in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
          assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution
          or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, prior to
          actually being received by the person entitled to the benefit
          under the terms of the Plan; and any attempt to anticipate,
          alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge,
          garnish, execute on, levy or otherwise dispose of any right to
          benefits payable hereunder, shall be void.  The Trust Fund shall
          not in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts,
          contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person
          entitled to benefits hereunder.  The foregoing provisions of this
          Section 16.4(a) shall not preclude the (1) enforcement of a
          Federal tax levy made pursuant to Section 6331 of the Internal
          Revenue Code or (2) collection by the United States on a judgment
          resulting from an unpaid tax assessment.

               (b)  Notwithstanding Section 16.4(a), the Trustee

                    (1)  shall comply with an order entered on or after
               January 1, 1985 determined by the Plan Administrator to be a
               Qualified Domestic Relations Order as provided in
               Section 16.5,

                    (2)  shall comply with a domestic relations order
               entered before January 1, 1985 if benefits are already being
               paid under such order, and<PAGE>

                    (3)  may treat an order entered before January 1, 1985
               as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order even if it does not
               meet the requirements of Section 16.5.

        16.5   Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

               (a)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order means any judgment,
          decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement
          agreement):

                    (1)  which is made pursuant to a state domestic
               relations law (including a community property law),

                    (2)  which relates to the provision of child support,
               alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse,
               former spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant,

                    (3)  which creates or recognizes the existence of an
               alternate payee's right to receive all or a portion of the
               Participant's Net Balance Account under the Plan, and

                    (4)  with respect to which the requirements of
               paragraphs (b) and (c) are met.

               (b)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order only if such order clearly specifies:

                    (1)  the name and the last known mailing address, if
               any, of the Participant and the name and mailing address of
               each alternate payee covered by the order,

                    (2)  the amount or percentage of the Participant's
               Accrued Benefit to be paid by the Plan to each such
               alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or
               percentage is to be determined,

                    (3)  the number of payments or period to which such
               order applies, and

                    (4)  each Plan to which such order applies.

               (c)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order only if such order does not:

                    (1)  require the plan to provide any type or form of
               benefit, or any option not otherwise provided under the
               Plan,

                    (2)  require the Plan to provide increased benefits
               (determined on the basis of actuarial value), or

                    (3)  require the payment of benefits to an alternate
               payee which are required to be paid to another alternate
               payee under another order previously determined to be a
               Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

               (d)  In the case of any payment before a Participant has had
          a Termination of Employment, a domestic relations order shall not
          be treated as failing to meet the requirements of Section<PAGE>
          16.5(c)(1) solely because such order requires that payment of
          benefits be made to an alternate payee:

                    (1)  (A) on or after the date on which the Participant
               attains (or would have attained) the age of 50, for periods
               before May 1, 1990, and (B) without regard to the
               Participant's attainment of any specified age, for periods
               after April 30, 1990.

                    (2)  as if the Participant had retired on the date on
               which such payment is to begin under such order; and

                    (3)  in any form in which such benefits may be paid
               under the Plan to the Participant (other than in the form of
               a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity with respect to the
               alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).

               (e)  To the extent provided in any Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order the former spouse of a Participant if married to
          the Participant for at least one year, shall be treated as the
          surviving spouse of such Participant for purposes of consenting
          to the waiver of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity as
          provided in Sections 11.2(f) and 11.10 and the naming of another
          Beneficiary to the extent provided in Sections 11.3 and 11.10.

               (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article X,
          if, pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, a
          segregated account is established containing the interest of an
          alternate payee, the alternate payee shall direct the manner in
          which such segregated account shall be invested in accordance
          with the procedures under Article X; provided that such
          segregated account shall remain invested in the same manner as
          the assets were invested before the account was segregated until
          the alternate payee's election in accordance with this
          Section 16.5(f) becomes effective.

        16.6   Unclaimed Amounts.  Unclaimed amounts shall consist of the
     amounts of the Accounts of a retired, deceased or terminated
     Participant (including amounts held in the Distribution Fund with
     respect to checks which are distributed but which are not cashed)
     which cannot be distributed because of the Committee's inability,
     after a reasonable search, to locate a Participant or his Beneficiary
     within a period of two (2) years after the payment of benefits becomes
     due.

          Unclaimed amounts with respect to Accounts held in the Profit
     Sharing Plan portion of the Plan for a Plan Year shall become a
     Forfeiture and shall be allocated for such Plan Year as determined in
     accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, within a reasonable time after the
     close of the Plan Year in which such two-year period shall end.  The
     Committee shall allocate Forfeitures with respect to Accounts held in
     the McDESOP portion of the Plan (excluding those arising in respect to
     an Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account) to Participants'
     Participant Elected Contribution Accounts and Employer Matching
     Contribution Accounts (a) for periods before December 1, 1994, in the
     same manner as trust income is allocated to such Accounts under
     Section 7.2 and (ii) effective December 1, 1994 and thereafter by
     crediting such Forfeitures to the Employer Matching Contribution
     Holding Fund as of the Valuation Date following the date the amount of
     such Forfeitures is determined for the immediately preceding Plan year<PAGE>
     but not later than March 31 of the year following the Plan year with
     respect to which such Forfeitures occurred.  Forfeitures arising in
     respect to an Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account to
     Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Accounts shall be
     allocated in the same manner as Forfeitures under Section 7.3 are
     allocated to such Accounts.

          If an unclaimed amount is subsequently properly claimed by the
     Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary ("Reclaimed Amount") and
     unless an Employer in its discretion makes a contribution to the Plan
     for such year in an amount sufficient to pay such Reclaimed Amount, it
     shall be charged as follows:

               (a)  To the extent such Reclaimed Amount originated as an
          unclaimed amount with respect to the Accounts held in the Profit
          Sharing Plan portion of the Plan, it shall be charged against
          Forfeitures from the Profit Sharing portion of the Plan and, if
          such Forfeitures are not sufficient, the remainder shall be
          treated as an expense of the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
          Plan during the Plan Year in which the Participant or Beneficiary
          makes such claim.

               (b)  To the extent that the Reclaimed Amount originated as
          an unclaimed amount with respect to the amounts held in the
          McDESOP portion of the Plan, excluding those arising in respect
          to an Employer Auxiliary ESOP Contribution Account, it shall be
          charged against Forfeitures for the Plan Year with respect to
          Participants' Participant Elected Contribution Accounts and
          Employer Matching Contribution Accounts and, to the extent such
          Forfeitures are not sufficient, shall be treated as an expense of
          that portion of the McDESOP portion of the Plan which excludes
          the portion of the McDESOP portion of the Plan which is held by
          the Trustee pursuant to the Auxiliary ESOP provisions of the
          Plan.

               (c)  To the extent that such Reclaimed Amount originated as
          an unclaimed amount in respect to an Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contribution Account, it shall be treated as a charge against
          Forfeitures arising under Sections 11.4 and 16.6 for the Plan
          Year with respect to Participants' Employer Auxiliary ESOP
          Contribution Accounts and, to the extent such Forfeitures are not
          sufficient, shall be treated as an expense of the Auxiliary ESOP
          portion of the McDESOP portion of the Plan.

        16.7   Maximum Age Condition.  Anything to the contrary herein
     notwithstanding, eligibility to participate in the Plan and to elect
     or receive allocations of contributions to the Trust shall not be
     subject to any restrictions on account of a maximum age condition.

        16.8   Invalidity of Certain Provisions.  If any provision of this
     Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
     unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and
     this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions, to
     the extent invalid or unenforceable, had not been included.

        16.9   Gender and Number.  Except when otherwise indicated by the
     context, any masculine terminology herein shall also include the
     feminine and the singular shall also include the plural.<PAGE>

        16.10  Law Governing.  This Plan and Trust shall be construed and
     enforced according to the laws of the State of Illinois other than its
     laws respecting choice of law, to the extent not preempted by ERISA.

     after application of the dollar limit and the denominator of which is
     the sum of such Compensation for the Affected Participant and the
     Affected Family Members.<PAGE>

          period of time during the Plan Year and had a Termination of
          Service because of retirement after age 55, death, or Disability,
          or (3) was a Participant for any period of time during the Plan
          Year and had a Termination of Service during the Plan Year and
          had at least 10 years of Credited Service under the Profit
          Sharing Plan portion of the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing
          Program as of the end of the Plan Year, in the proportion that
          each such Participant's Considered Compensation for the Plan Year
          bears to the Aggregate Considered Compensation for the Plan Year
          for all such Participants.

               3.4  Limits on Allocation and Contributions.  Any of the
          provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no amount
          shall be allocated to the Account of any Participant in excess of
          the maximum amount permitted to be allocated to a participant in
          a plan of this type as described in Section 401 of the Internal
          Revenue Code and no amount shall be contributed by any Employer
          in excess of the maximum amount permitted to be contributed by
          such Employer to a plan of this type as described in Section 401
          of the Internal Revenue Code.

          3.5  Contributions Irrevocable.  Amounts contributed by an
     Employer to the Plan shall, subject to the provisions of Section 3.6,
     be irrevocable, shall not be returned to any Employer, and shall
     continue to be allocated in accordance with the provisions of the Plan
     notwithstanding any circumstances under which any Employer suffers
     recapture of the tax credit obtained initially through the Employer
     Contributions to the Plan; provided however, that if, and to the
     extent that the amount of Employer Matching Contributions for a Plan
     Year exceeds the amount of Participant Matched Contributions for such
     Plan Year, such excess shall be returned to the Employer.

          3.6  Maximum Limitations on Contributions.

               (a)  Limitations on Contributions.  Any of the provisions
          herein to the contrary notwithstanding, a Participant's Annual
          Additions for any Plan Year shall not exceed his Maximum Annual
          Additions for the Plan Year.  If a Participant's Annual Additions
          exceed his Maximum Annual Additions (the "Annual Excess"), the
          Participant's Annual Additions for the Plan Year shall be reduced
          under Section 3.6(c) by the amount necessary to eliminate such
          Annual Excess.<PAGE>

               (b)  Definitions.

                    (1)  "Annual Additions" of a Participant for a Plan
               Year means the sum of the following:

                    contributions and forfeitures for such Plan Year
                    allocated to such Participant's accounts for such Plan
                    Year under any other Related Defined Contribution Plan,
                    not already included under Section 3.6(b)(1)(A)
                    provided that Forfeitures of employer securities under
                    the Employer Auxiliary ESOP portion of the Profit
                    Sharing Program and employer contributions used to
                    repay interest on an exempt loan thereunder shall not
                    be included under this Section 3.6(b)(1)(B);

                         (C)  the amount of nondeductible participant
                    contributions under this Plan or any Related Plan made

                    medical account (as defined in Code Section 401(h))
                    which is part of a defined benefit plan maintained by
                    an Employer as provided in Code Section 415(1) and any
                    amount attributable to post-retirement medical benefits
                    allocated to an account established under Internal
                    Revenue Code Section 419(d)(1).

                    (2)  "Maximum Annual Addition" of a Participant for a
               Plan Year means effective for Plan Years beginning on or
               before July 12, 1989 the greater of (A) and (B) below and
               effective for Plan Years beginning after July 12, 1989, the
               amount in (A) below:

                         (A)  the lesser of (i) and (ii) below:

                              (i)  25% of the Participant's Compensation,
                         or

                              (ii) the greater of (I) $30,000 or
                         (II) one-fourth (1/4) of the amount in effect

                         Code ($98,064 in 1989, adjusted in subsequent
                         years for cost of living adjustments determined in
                         accordance with regulations prescribed by the
                         Secretary of Treasury or his delegate pursuant to
                         the provisions of Section 415(d) of the Internal
                         Revenue Code).

                              (i)  25% of the Participant's Compensation,

                         (a) $30,000 or (b) one-fourth (1/4) of the amount
                         in effect under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the
                         Internal Revenue Code ($98,064 for 1989, adjusted
                         in subsequent years for cost of living adjustments
                         determined in accordance with regulations
                         prescribed by the Secretary of Treasury or his
                         delegate pursuant to the provisions of
                         Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code), and
                         (II) the lesser of (a) the amount determined under
                         clause (I) above and (b) the Participant's
                         leveraged ESOP Annual Additions for the Plan Year
                         under the McDonald's Profit Sharing Program.

               (c)  If a Participant has an Annual Excess for a Plan Year,
          the Annual Excess shall be eliminated as follows:

                    (1)  The allocations to the Participant's accounts
               under McDonald's Profit Sharing Program shall be reduced as
               provided therein.

                    (2)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               paragraph (1), Additional Employer Contributions, in that
               order, shall be reduced to the extent such reductions reduce
               the amount of the remaining Annual Excess.

                    (3)  Subject to Section 3.6(c)(5), any allocations of
               Additional Employer Contributions reduced or eliminated
               under this Section 3.6 shall, subject to the limits of this
               Section 3.6, be reallocated to the Accounts of the other
               Participants as of the last day of the Plan Year in the same
               manner as such Employer Contributions were initially
               allocated under Section 3.3.  Any Additional Employer
               Contributions which cannot, under the limits of this
               Section 3.6, be reallocated to the Accounts of other
               Participants in the Plan Year shall, subject to the limits
               of this Section 3.6, be held in an unallocated suspense
               account and reallocated in the subsequent Plan Year.  If the
               Plan is terminated, any amounts held in an unallocated
               suspense account not then allocated shall, to the maximum
               extent permitted under Section 3.6(a), be allocated among
               Participants in the Plan Year of termination and any amounts
               in excess of such limit shall be returned to the Employers.

               (d)  If a Participant participates in any Related Defined
          Benefit Plan, the sum of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction (as
          defined in Section 415(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code) and
          the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction (as defined in
          Section 415(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) for such
          Participant shall not exceed 1.0 (called the "Combined
          Fraction").  If the Combined Fraction of such Participant exceeds
          1.0, the Participant's Defined Benefit Plan Fraction shall be
          reduced by limiting the Participant's annual benefits payable
          from the Related Defined Benefit Plan in which he participates to
          the extent necessary to reduce the Combined Fraction of such
          Participant to 1.0, and to the extent the Combined Fraction
          continues to exceed 1.0, by reducing the Participant's Maximum<PAGE>
          Annual Additions to the extent necessary to reduce the Combined
          Fraction to 1.0.

                                   SECTION IV

                                   Trust Fund

          4.1  Trust Fund.  All assets held under the Plan shall be held in
     the Trust Fund pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Trust
     Agreement, and shall be invested primarily in shares of common stock
     of the Company.  The Trustee is specifically authorized to invest up
     to 100% of the assets of the Trust Fund in shares of common stock of
     the Company. The Trustee may, at its discretion, retain in cash an
     amount equal to the value of fractional shares allocable to
     Participants entitled to receive an immediate distribution from the
     Plan and amounts permitted to be so held pursuant to Section 4.9
     hereof.

          4.2  Determination of Increase or Decrease in Net Worth of the
     Trust Fund.  As of each Valuation Date the Trustee shall determine the
     fair market value of the Trust and give written notice thereof to the
     Committee.  The Trustee's determination of fair market value shall be
     final and conclusive on all persons.  The net income thus derived from
     the Trust shall be accumulated and shall from time to time be invested
     as a part of the Trust Fund.  As of each Valuation Date, the Committee
     shall determine the Trust Fund's net income, gains or losses since
     immediately preceding Valuation Date, and shall proportionately
     allocate such net income, gains or losses among (a) the sum of all
     Participants' Accounts, and (b) the sum of amounts held in a suspense
     account under Section 3.6(c), all valued as of the immediately
     preceding Valuation Date.  Thereafter, the Committee shall credit (or
     charge) each Account of a Participant with such allocated net income,
     gains or losses by multiplying such allocated net income, gains or
     losses by a fraction, the numerator of which is the balance of such
     Participant's Account, reduced by the amount of any distributions
     therefrom, as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, and the
     denominator of which is the total value of all Participants' Accounts,
     reduced by the amount of any distributions therefrom, as of the
     immediately preceding Valuation Date.

          4.3  Statement of Accounts.  As soon as practicable after the
     last day of each Plan Year, the Committee shall deliver to each
     Participant a statement of his Account.

          4.4  Participant Rights.  Each Participant shall have the right
     to direct the Committee with respect to shares (and fractional shares)
     of stock of the Company allocated to his Account as to the manner of
     voting such shares (and fractional shares) and such other rights
     (including, but not limited to the right to sell or retain such shares
     in extraordinary instances involving an unusual price and terms and
     conditions for shares of common stock of the Company such as a tender
     offer) as the Participant would be entitled to exercise if the
     Participant were the shareholder of record for such shares as provided
     in Section 7.8(c).  In the event that a Participant shall fail to
     direct the Committee as to the manner of voting shares of stock
     allocated to the Participant's Account or as to the exercise of other
     rights in respect of such shares, the Committee shall direct the
     Trustee not to vote such shares or exercise such rights. The Company<PAGE>
     shall notify each Participant of his rights (and the Committee of the
     Participants' rights), as described under this Section 4.4, a
     reasonable period prior to the date on which such rights must be
     exercised (not less than 30 days prior to such date unless a lesser
     period, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, is permitted,
     considering applicable law and provisions with respect to shareholders
     of the Company generally under the Company's by-laws) and provide each
     Participant with all information with respect to such rights that a
     shareholder of record would receive.

          4.5  Participant's Interest in the Trust Fund.  The Participant's
     interest in the Trust Fund shall include all assets of the Trust Fund
     allocated to the Participant's Account and any dividends or other
     distributions made in respect thereto.  All assets allocated to the
     Participant's Account and all dividends or distributions received in
     respect of assets held in the Participant's Account shall be invested
     and reinvested in shares of common stock of the Company.

          4.6  Expenses of the Trust Fund.  Effective for periods before
     January 1, 1990, all expenses of the Plan and of the Trust
     ("Expenses") of whatever kind including, but not limited to,
     administrative and legal expenses, shall be paid by the Company and
     shall in no event be paid with any assets of the Trust Fund.
     Effective on or after January 1, 1990, Expenses shall be paid by the
     Trust from Forfeitures in accordance with Section 10.7 to the extent
     not paid by an Employer.

          4.7  Separate Accounting For Contributions.  Separate Accounts
     shall be maintained for each Participant as described
     in Section l.l hereof.

          4.8  Correction of Error.  In the event of any error, including
     but not limited to an error in the adjustment of a Participant's
     Accounts, an error in including or excluding persons as Participants,
     or otherwise, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may correct such
     error by either crediting or charging the adjustment required or such
     adjustment as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine to
     be equitable, in order to make such correction either to or against
     unclaimed amounts in accordance with Section 10.7 or to or against
     income and expenses of the Plan for the Plan Year in which the
     correction is made, or in the discretion of the Company, by Additional
     Employer Contributions to the Plan.

          4.9  Distribution Fund.  Any of the provisions herein to the
     contrary notwithstanding, the Committee shall have the authority to
     direct the Trustee to transfer amounts currently distributable in cash
     to Participants who have had a Termination of Service to a
     distribution fund (the "Distribution Fund") during the calendar
     quarter next following the calendar quarter within which such amounts
     became distributable occurred.  The Distribution Fund shall be held
     (a) in a checking account of the Trustee in the name of the Trust with
     the Trustee's banking department, and (b) in short term liquid
     investments, in such types of investments or pooled, common,
     commingled or collective trust funds, including those of the Trustee,
     as the Committee may from time to time authorize the Trustee to invest
     in such respective amounts and proportions and in such manner as the
     Committee shall from time to time determine.  The Committee may
     authorize one or more of its members, or their designees, to sign,<PAGE>
     manually, or by facsimile signature, any and all checks, drafts, and
     orders, including orders or directions in informal or letter form,
     against any funds in the Distribution Fund and the Trustee is
     authorized to honor any and all checks, drafts and orders so signed.
     Income, gains, losses and expenses of the Distribution Fund as of the
     last day of each calendar quarter (to the extent not paid by an
     Employer), shall be determined separately.  Any net income of the
     Distribution Fund shall be added to the net income of the Trust Fund
     for such calendar quarter and any net losses of the Distribution Fund
     for a Plan Year shall be paid by the Company.  Checks for amounts
     transferred to the Distribution Fund, shall be written and sent to
     each Participant within 90 days after such amount has been transferred
     to the Distribution Fund.

          4.10 Diversification.  Within 90 days after the last Valuation
     Date within the Qualified Election Period, a Qualified Participant may
     make a diversification election with respect to the Specified Portion
     of his Accounts.  The specified portion of a Participant's Accounts
     which he elects to diversify shall be distributed to the Participant
     within 90 days after the Qualified Election Period.  Distributions
     shall be made in accordance with this Section 4.10 not withstanding
     the requirement that employer securities be held in the Plan for 84
     months after the date of acquisition by the Plan.  As used herein, the
     following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

               (a)  "Qualified Election Period" means the 6-Plan Year
          period beginning with the later of:

                    (1)  the first Plan Year in which the individual first
               becomes a  Qualified Participant, or

                    (2)  the first Plan Year beginning after December 31,
               1986.

               (b)  "Qualified Participant" means any Participant who has
          completed at least ten years of participation in the Plan and has
          attained age 55.

               (c)  "Specified Portion" means 25 percent of the shares of
          common stock of McDonald's corporation acquired by the Plan after
          December 31, 1986; provided that the Participant's Specified
          Portion shall be zero unless the value of such common stock of
          McDonald's Corporation is equal to or more than $500.  In a
          Participant's sixth Qualified Election Period, the preceding
          sentence shall be applied by substituting "50 percent" for
          "25 percent".  The amount which shall be subject to a
          diversification election shall equal (A)(i) 25 percent and 50
          percent, as applicable, be multiplied by (ii) the sum of (a) the
          value of the common stock of McDonald's Corporation credited to
          the Participant's Accounts plus (b) the amounts previously
          distributed pursuant to this Section 4.10 and Section 5.4 reduced
          by (B) the amounts previously distributed pursuant to this
          Section 4.10.

          The foregoing provisions shall apply only to the extent that a
     Participant is not otherwise eligible to elect to receive
     distributions of amounts eligible to be distributed hereunder in
     accordance with Section 5.4 during a Qualified Election Period.<PAGE>


                                   SECTION V

                            Distribution of Benefits

          5.1  Payment of Benefits in General.  A Participant's benefits
     under this Plan shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of
     this Article.

               (a)  If a Participant has a Termination of Service due to
          retirement on or after his Benefits Retirement Date, Total and
          Permanent Disability, or for any other reason other than death,
          the Participant's Accrued Benefit shall be payable in a lump sum
          in accordance with and subject to the limitations of Section 5.2.

               (b)  If a Participant dies, his Accrued Benefit shall be
          payable to his surviving spouse if he was married at the time of
          his death, or to his other Beneficiary or Beneficiaries if he was
          not married at the time of his death or to the extent he is
          permitted to name a Beneficiary other than his surviving spouse
          in a lump sum in accordance with and subject to the limitations
          of Section 5.3.

               (c)  A Participant may elect to receive an in-service
          distribution of his Accrued Benefit in accordance with and
          subject to the limitations of Section 5.4.

               (d)  If a Participant is otherwise entitled to a
          distribution due to retirement on or after Benefits Retirement
          Date, Total and Permanent Disability, death or other Termination
          of Service, the Committee may require the immediate distribution
          of small vested Accrued Benefits in accordance with and subject
          to the limitations of Section 5.9, notwithstanding the provisions
          of Sections 5.2, and 5.3.

          5.2  Distributions of Participant's Accounts.  If the value of a
     Participant's Considered Accounts is not greater than $3,500 on the
     Valuation Date immediately following his Termination of Service,
     within a reasonable time after such Valuation Date, the Participant's
     Accounts shall be distributed to the Participant; and within a
     reasonable time after the date on which the Company makes its
     contribution to the Trust for the Plan Year in which the Participant
     has a Termination of Service, the Participant shall receive a
     distribution of any amount credited after the initial distribution to
     his Accounts for such Plan Year.  If the value of a Participant's
     Considered Accounts is greater than $3,500 on the Valuation Date
     immediately following his Termination of Service, the Participant's
     Accounts shall be distributed at an administratively convenient time
     (but not later than April 1) in the year following the later of the
     year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2 or has a Termination
     of Service, unless such Participant elects in writing to receive a
     lump sum distribution at an earlier date.

          The term, "Considered Accounts" as used in this Section 5.2 shall
     have the following meaning:

          Accounts under the Plan; and<PAGE>

               (b)  Effective on and after July 1, 1993, the sum of (1) the

          distribution and (2) his vested Net Balance Account under the
          Profit Sharing Program.

          5.3  Death of Participant.

               (a)  Form of Payment.  If a Participant dies before the
          Participant's Accounts have been paid from the Plan, distribution
          shall be made as follows:

                    (1)  If the Participant has a surviving spouse, the
               Trustee shall distribute the Participant's Accounts to the
               Participant's surviving spouse as the Participant's
               Beneficiary in accordance with Section 5.3(b) unless the
               Participant has named another Beneficiary, the Participant's
               spouse has consented in accordance with Section 5.8.

                    (2)  If the Participant does not have a surviving
               spouse or if the Participant, with his spouse's consent in
               accordance with Section 5.8, has named another Beneficiary,
               the Trustee shall distribute the Participant's Accounts in
               accordance with Section 5.3(a)(3) to the Beneficiary named
               by the Participant in accordance with Section 5.3(b).

                    (3)  The Participant's Accounts shall be distributed
               within a reasonable time after the Valuation Date following
               the Participant's death in a lump sum except as provided in
               Section 5.7, and any amount credited after the initial
               distribution to the Participant's Accounts for the Plan Year
               will also be so distributed within a reasonable time after
               the date on which the Company makes its contribution to the
               Trust for the Plan Year within which the Participant dies.

               (b)  Beneficiary Designation.  Subject to Section 5.3(a),
          the Participant may change his designation of Beneficiary from
          time to time by filing a new Beneficiary designation form with
          the Committee.  No designation of Beneficiary or change in
          designation of Beneficiary shall be effective until filed with
          the Committee.  Except as provided in Section 5.3(a)(1), if a
          Participant shall fail to file a valid Beneficiary designation
          form, or if all persons designated on the Beneficiary designation
          form predecease the Participant, the Trustee shall distribute
          such Participant's Accounts in a lump sum to the following
          persons, in the following order of precedence:

                    (1)  His surviving spouse;

                    (2)  Those persons designated by the Participant to
               receive his death benefits under the Group Life Insurance
               Program of the Employer or, in the absence of such
               designation, under the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
               McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program;

                    (3)  The person or entity who receives the
               Participant's McDonald's group term life insurance benefits
               whether or not designated as beneficiary by the Participant;<PAGE>

                    (4)  Lawful descendants including adopted children, per
               stirpes;

                    (5)  Parents in equal shares, or (if only one parent

                    (6)  Lawful descendants of his parents, per stirpes;
               and

                    (7)  His estate.

               (c)  Period of Distribution to Beneficiary.  Notwithstanding
          any other provisions of this Plan or any elections made by a
          Participant or Beneficiary, the Participant's Accrued Benefit
          shall be distributed within five (5) years of the Participant's
          death.

          5.4  Participant Withdrawals.  A Participant may, on a form at
     such time and in such manner as the Committee shall prescribe, elect
     to have distributed to him in shares of common stock of the Company,
     the shares which have been allocated to his Account for eighty-four
     (84) months following the month in which such shares were allocated to
     his Account, provided that such withdrawals shall consist of whole
     shares.

          5.5  Form of Distributions.  The form of distribution to a
     Participant or Beneficiary shall be as follows:

               (a)  Effective before January 1, 1993:

                    (1)  If the distribution would be five (5) or more
               shares of common stock of the Company, the distribution
               shall be in the form of shares of common stock of the
               Company unless the Participant or Beneficiary elects to
               receive payment in cash.

                    (2)  If the distribution would be fewer than five (5)
               shares of common stock of the Company, the distribution
               shall be in the form of cash, unless the Participant or
               Beneficiary elects to receive payment in the form of shares
               of common stock of the Company.

               (b)  Effective on or after January 1, 1993:

                    (1)  If amount to be distributed from the Participant's
               Account has a value of $1500 or more, the distribution shall
               be in the form of shares of common stock of the Company
               unless the Participant or Beneficiary elects to receive
               payment in cash.

                    (2)  If the amount to be distributed has a value of
               less than $1500, the distribution shall be in the form of
               cash, unless the Participant or Beneficiary elects to
               receive payment in the form of shares of common stock of the
               Company.<PAGE>

          A Participant or Beneficiary may exercise his right to elect the
     form of distribution by filing a written election with the Committee
     on forms approved by the Committee at the time and in a manner
     prescribed by the Committee on or before the date of distribution.

          If a Participant or Beneficiary receives a cash distribution, the
     value of his Account shall be determined as of the last day preceding
     the date of distribution.

          If a Participant's interest in his Account is distributable and
     includes a fractional share, the fractional share shall be distributed
     to the Participant in cash.

          5.6  Incompetency, Distribution of Benefits.  In the event a
     Participant or Beneficiary is declared an incompetent or is a minor,
     and a conservator, guardian or other person legally charged with his
     care is appointed, any benefits to which such Participant or
     Beneficiary is entitled shall be distributable to such conservator,
     guardian or other person legally charged with his care.

          If a Participant or Beneficiary is incompetent, a minor or in the
     opinion of the Committee, would fail to derive benefit from
     distribution of his Account and, if a conservator, guardian or other
     person legally charged for his care has not been appointed, the
     Committee, in its sole and exclusive discretion, may (a) require the
     appointment of a conservator or guardian, (b) distribute the
     Participant's Account to relatives of the Participant or Beneficiary
     for the benefit of the Participant or Beneficiary, or (c) distribute
     such Account directly to or for the benefit of the Participant or
     Beneficiary.

          The decision of the Committee in such matters shall be final,
     binding and conclusive upon the Employer and the Trustee and upon each
     Employee, Participant, Beneficiary and every other person or party
     interested or concerned, and neither the Employer, the Committee nor
     the Trustee shall be under any duty to see to the proper application
     of such distributions made to a Participant or Beneficiary, or
     conservator, guardian or relatives of a Participant or Beneficiary.

          5.7  Deduction of Taxes from Amounts Payable.  The Trustee may
     deduct from the amount to be distributed such amount as the Trustee,
     in its sole discretion, deems proper to protect the Plan
     Administrator, Trustee and the Trust against liability for the payment
     of death, succession, inheritance, income, or other taxes, and out of
     the money so deducted, the Trustee may discharge any such liability
     and pay the amount remaining to the Participant, the Beneficiary or
     the deceased Participant's estate, as the case may be.

          5.8  Spousal Consent to Waiver.  A valid spousal consent to the
     Participant's naming of a Beneficiary other than his spouse shall be:

               (a)  in a writing acknowledging the effect of the consent;

               (b)  witnessed by a notary public; and

               (c)  effective only for the spouse who exercises the
          consent;<PAGE>

     provided that notwithstanding the provisions of this Section V, the
     consent of a Participant's spouse shall not be required if it is
     established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that such
     consent may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the
     spouse cannot be located or because of such other circumstances as the
     Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.

          5.9  Latest Time of Distribution.  Any provision herein to the
     contrary notwithstanding, distribution shall be made to a Participant
     not later than sixty (60) days after the latest of the close of the
     Plan Year in which (a) occurs the Participant's Benefits Retirement
     Date, (b) the Participant has a Termination of Service, and (c) occurs
     the 10th anniversary of the year in which the Participant commenced
     participation in the Plan; provided that, all of a Participant's
     Accounts shall be distributed not later than the Participant's
     Required Beginning Date and further provided that, a Participant, who
     is entitled to receive a distribution pursuant to Section V, must
     submit a claim for benefits before any distribution will be made
     hereunder.

          5.10 Direct Rollovers.  This Section 10.5 applies to
     distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.

               (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
          contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election
          under this Section 5.10, a Distributee may elect, at the time and
          in the manner prescribed by the Committee, to have any portion of
          an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible
          Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct
          Rollover; subject to such reasonable administrative requirements
          as the Committee may from time to time establish which may
          include, but shall not be limited to, requirements consistent
          with Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued by the
          Internal Revenue Service permitting de minimis standards for
          amounts eligible to be rolled over or paid partly to the
          Participant and partly rolled over.  A Participant may make an
          election pursuant to this Section 5.10 only after the Distributee
          has met otherwise applicable requirements for receipt of a
          distribution under the Plan, including but not limited to any
          applicable requirements that the Participant's spouse or
          (pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as defined in
          Section 10.5) former spouse consent to the Participant's waiver
          of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualified
          Preretirement Survivor Annuity.

          If a Participant or Beneficiary elects to receive a Direct
     Rollover, such distribution may be made or commence to be made less
     than 30 days after the notice required under Section 1.411(a)-11(c) of
     the Income Tax Regulations is given, provided that:

                    (A)  the Committee shall clearly inform the Participant
               or Beneficiary that he has a right to a period of at least
               30 days after receiving the notice to consider the decision
               of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if
               applicable, a particular distribution option), and

                    (B)  the Participant or Beneficiary after receiving the
               notice affirmatively elects a distribution.<PAGE>

               (b)  In the absence of the adoption by the Committee of any
          requirements to the contrary, the following shall apply:

                    (A)  A Distributee whose Eligible Rollover Distribution
               is less than $200 upon the Valuation Date immediately
               preceding the date of distribution shall not be permitted to
               elect to have all or any portion of the distribution made in
               the form of a Direct Rollover.

                    (B)  A Distributee who elects a Direct Rollover in an
               amount equal to at least $500 may also elect to have the
               remaining portion of his distribution paid to the
               Distributee.

                    (C)  A Distributee shall be permitted to divide an
               Eligible Rollover Distribution into separate distributions
               to be paid to two or more Eligible Retirement Plans in two
               or more Direct Rollovers.

                    (D)  A Distributee's election to make or not to make a
               Direct Rollover with respect to a payment in a series of
               periodic payments shall apply to all subsequent payments in
               the series until the Distributee changes his election.

                    (E)  If a Distributee, who has been notified as to the
               availability of the Direct Rollover option, fails to elect a
               Direct Rollover with respect to an Eligible Rollover
               Distribution, such Distributee shall be deemed to have
               elected not to make a Direct Rollover.

               (c)  As used in this Section 5.10, the following terms shall
          have the following meanings:

                    (A)  "Eligible Rollover Distribution" means any
               distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
               credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover
               Distribution does not include:  any distribution that is one
               of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not
               less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
               expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint
               life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's
               designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten
               years or more; any distribution to the extent such
               distribution is required under Section 5.2; and the portion
               of any distribution that is not includable in gross income
               (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
               unrealized appreciation with respect to employer
               securities).

                    (B)  "Eligible Retirement Plan" means an individual
               retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the
               Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity

               Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distributions.  However, in<PAGE>
               the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to a
               Participant's surviving spouse or surviving former spouse
               who is a Distributee pursuant to a Qualified Domestic
               Relations Order, an Eligible Retirement Plan is an
               individual retirement account or individual retirement
               annuity.

                    (C)  "Distributee" means a Participant.  In addition, a
               Participant's surviving spouse and a former spouse who is
               the alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations
               Order are Distributees with regard to the interest of such
               spouse or former spouse.

                    (D)  "Direct Rollover" means a payment by the Plan to

                                   SECTION VI

                            Subsidiary Participation

          6.1  Adoption of Plan and Trust by a Subsidiary.  Any Subsidiary
     of the Company may, with the approval of the Board of Directors and
     under such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may
     prescribe, adopt the Plan and Trust by resolution of its own board of
     directors.

         6.2  Withdrawal from Plan by Participating Employer.  While it is
     not the present intention of any Employer to withdraw from the Plan,
     any Employer other than the Company shall have the right, at any time,
     to withdraw from the Plan and Trust by delivering to the Committee and
     the Trustee written notice of its election to so withdraw.

          Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the Accounts of
     Participants employed by the withdrawing Employer as of the date of
     withdrawal shall thereafter be distributable
     in shares of common stock of the Company by the Trustee at the
     discretion of the Committee at such time or times as the Committee, in
     its sole discretion, may deem to be in the best interest of such
     Participants or their Beneficiaries, provided that, except as provided
     in Section 10.6, no distribution shall be made to a Participant with
     respect to shares of common stock of the Company which have been
     allocated to the Participant's Account for less than eighty-four (84)
     months following the month in which such shares were allocated to the
     Participant's Account, unless the Participant shall have a separation
     from service as defined in Section 409(d) of the Internal Revenue
     Code.

                                  SECTION VII

                           Administration of the Plan

          7.1  Appointment of Trustee.  The Board of Directors shall have
     the power to remove the Trustee, with or without cause, upon thirty
     (30) days' written notice to the Trustee unless the Trustee agrees to
     a shorter period, and to appoint a successor to a Trustee which has
     resigned or been removed, and, with the consent of the Trustee or
     Trustees, to appoint a co-Trustee or co-Trustees.<PAGE>

          The appointment of a successor Trustee or co-Trustee shall become
     effective upon acceptance in writing of such appointment by the
     successor Trustee or co-Trustee.  The successor Trustee or co-Trustee
     may be either a corporate Trustee or an individual Trustee, and the
     successor Trustee or co-Trustee shall have no liability for anything
     done or omitted to be done by the former Trustee or co-Trustee prior
     to the appointment of the successor Trustee or co-Trustee. Each
     successor Trustee appointed to and accepting a Trusteeship hereunder
     shall have all the rights, title, powers, duties, exemptions and
     limitations of the original Trustee.

          7.2  Appointment of Committee; Tenure in Office.  The Committee,
     which shall be the Administrator of the Plan, unless the Committee
     shall appoint an Employee to act as Plan Administrator, shall consist
     of not less than five (5) members who shall be appointed by the Board
     of Directors. The Board of Directors shall have power to determine the
     period during which any Committee member shall serve and, in its
     discretion, may remove any member of the Committee at any time without
     assigning any reason therefor.  Upon a vacancy occurring upon the
     death, resignation or removal by the Board of Directors of any member
     of the Committee, a successor shall be appointed by the Board of
     Directors within ninety (90) days after such event.  Until a vacancy
     in the Committee is filled by the Board of Directors the remaining
     members of the Committee shall continue to act as the Committee.  The
     Board of Directors shall certify to the Trustee the names of the
     members of the Committee and, thereafter, any change in its
     membership.

          7.3  Named Fiduciaries.  The Company, the Board of Directors, the
     Committee and every employee of the Company, its subsidiaries or
     affiliates who becomes a fiduciary by virtue of the delegation of
     duties, responsibilities and authority with respect to the
     administration and operation of the Plan in accordance with this
     Section 7 shall be considered "named fiduciaries" as provided in
     Section 402(a)(2) of ERISA, and accordingly afforded the protection
     provided for in Section 405(c)(2) of ERISA with respect to named
     fiduciaries.

          7.4  Delegation of Responsibilities.  The Committee and the Board
     of Directors shall have the authority to delegate, from time to time,
     by instrument in writing, all or any part of its responsibilities
     under the Plan (including the power to delegate) to such person or
     persons as it may deem advisable, and in the same manner to revoke any
     such delegation of responsibility.  Periodically, the delegate shall
     report to the Committee or Board of Directors concerning the discharge
     of the delegated responsibilities.  Any action of the delegate in the
     exercise of such delegated responsibilities shall have the same force
     and effect for all purposes hereunder as if such action had been taken
     by the Committee or the Board of Directors.  Neither the Committee,
     the Board of Directors nor any of their members shall be liable for
     the acts or omissions of such delegate except as otherwise required by
     federal law.

          7.5  Committee Action by Majority - Authorization of Members to
     Execute Documents.  The Committee may act at a meeting (including a
     telephonic meeting) by the consent of a majority of its members or
     without a meeting by the unanimous written consent of its members.<PAGE>

          No member of the Committee shall vote or decide upon any matter
     relating solely to himself or to his specific rights or benefits under
     the Plan.

          The Committee may authorize any of its members to execute on its
     behalf any document which reflects an action or decision of the
     Committee and the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
     names of its members so authorized.  Until the Committee revokes or

          7.6  Secretary.  The Committee shall appoint a Secretary (who
     may, but need not be a member of the Committee) to keep records of the
     acts and resolutions of the Committee.  The Secretary may also perform
     such other duties which may, from time to time, be delegated to him in
     writing by the Committee.

          7.7  Member as Participant.  A member of the Committee who is
     also a Participant or a Beneficiary shall receive any benefit to which
     he may be entitled as a Participant or Beneficiary in the Plan so long
     as such benefit is computed and paid on a basis that is consistent
     with the terms of the Plan as applied to all other Participants and
     Beneficiaries.

          accordance with Section 4.7 of the Plan.

          7.9  Rules and Decisions.  The Committee may, from time to time,
     adopt such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or desirable
     which are consistent with the provisions or the purposes of the Plan.
     All rules and decisions of the Committee shall be uniformly and
     consistently applied to all Participants in similar circumstances.
     The Committee shall be entitled to, but need not, rely upon
     information furnished by a Participant or Beneficiary, a delegate, an
     Employer or Employee, a prior Licensee, the Trustee or the Company.

          7.10 Agents and Counsel.  The Committee and its delegates shall
     have the authority to appoint or employ individuals to assist or to
     advise in the administration of the Plan and any other agent deemed
     advisable, including but not limited to, independent certified public
     accountants and legal and actuarial counsel, who may but need not be
     the accountants or the legal or the actuarial counsel of the Company.

          7.11 Authorization of Benefit Distribution.  The Committee shall
     issue directions to the Trustee concerning all distributions to be
     made from the Trust Fund pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, and
     warrants that all such directions are in accordance with the Plan.

          7.12 Claims Procedure.

               (a)  Each Participant or Beneficiary (for purposes of this
          Section called a "Claimant") may submit his claim for benefits to
          the Plan Administrator in writing in such form as is permitted by
          the Committee.  A Claimant shall have no right to seek review of
          a denial of benefits, or to bring any action in any court to
          enforce a claim for benefits, prior to his filing a claim for
          benefits and exhausting his rights to review in accordance with
          this Section.

               When a claim for benefits has been filed properly, such
          claim for benefits shall be evaluated and the Claimant shall be
          notified of the approval or the denial within ninety (90) days
          after the receipt of such claim unless special circumstances
          require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If such
          an extension of time for processing is required, written notice
          of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the
          termination of the initial ninety (90) day period, and such
          notice shall specify the special circumstances requiring an
          extension and the date by which a final decision will be reached
          (which date shall not be later than one hundred and eighty (180)
          days after the date on which the claim was filed).  A Claimant
          shall be given a written notice in which he shall be advised as
          to whether the claim is granted or denied, in whole or in part.
          If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant shall be
          given written notice which shall contain (1) the specific reasons
          for the denial, (2) references to pertinent Plan provisions on
          which the denial is based, (3) a description of any additional
          material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an<PAGE>
          explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and
          (4) the Claimant's rights to seek review of the denial.

               (b)  If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant
          shall have the right to request that the Committee review the
          denial, provided that he files a written request for review with
          the Committee within sixty (60) days after the date on which he
          received written notification of the denial.  A Claimant (or his
          duly authorized representative) may review pertinent documents
          and submit issues and comments in writing to the Committee.
          Within sixty (60) days after a request for review is received,
          the review shall be made and the Claimant shall be advised in
          writing of the decision on review, unless special circumstances
          require an extension of time for processing the review, in which
          case the Claimant shall, within such initial sixty (60) day
          period, be given a written notification specifying the reasons
          for the extension and when such review shall be completed
          (provided that such review shall be completed within one hundred
          and twenty (120) days after the date on which the request for
          review was filed).  The decision on review shall be forwarded to
          the Claimant in writing and shall include specific reasons for
          the decision and references to Plan provisions upon which the
          decision is based. A decision on review shall be final and
          binding on all persons for all purposes.  If a Claimant shall
          fail to file a request for review in accordance with the
          procedures herein outlined, such Claimant shall have no rights to
          review and shall have no right to bring action in any court, and
          the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on all
          persons for all purposes.

          7.13 Information to be Furnished to Committee.  The Company and
     Employers shall furnish the Committee or its delegate such data and
     information as the Committee may reasonably request.

          Participants and their Beneficiaries shall furnish to the
     Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee or its
     delegate shall request.

          7.14 Fiduciary Responsibility.  If a Plan fiduciary acts in
     accordance with ERISA, Title I, Subtitle B, Part 4:

               (a)  in determining that the Participant's spouse has
          consented to the naming of a Beneficiary other than the spouse or
          that the consent of the Participant's spouse may not be obtained
          because there is no spouse, the spouse cannot be located or other
          circumstances prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury by
          regulations, then to the extent of payments made pursuant to such
          consent, revocation or determination, the Plan and its
          fiduciaries shall have no further liability.

               (b)  in treating a domestic relations order as being (or not
          being) a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, or, during any
          period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order
          is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is being determined (by
          the Committee, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
          otherwise), in segregating in a separate account in the Plan or
          in an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable to
          the alternate payee during such period if the order had been<PAGE>
          determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, in paying
          the amounts segregated or held in escrow to the person entitled
          thereto if within 18 months the domestic relations order (or a
          modification thereof) is determined to be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order, in paying such amounts to the person entitled
          thereto if there had been no order, if within 18 months the
          domestic relations order is determined not to be qualified or if
          the issue is not resolved within 18 months and in prospectively
          applying a domestic relations order which is determined to be
          qualified after the close of the 18-month period, then the
          obligation of the Plan and its fiduciaries to the Participant and
          each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any
          payment made pursuant to such acts.

          7.15 Fiduciary as Participant.  A fiduciary who is also a
     Participant or a Beneficiary shall receive any benefit to which he may
     be entitled as a Participant or Beneficiary in the Plan so long as
     such benefit is computed and paid on a basis that is consistent with
     the terms of the Plan as applied to all other Participants and
     Beneficiaries.

                                  SECTION VIII

            Amendment, Termination, Merger and Consolidation of Plan

          8.1  Amendment.  The Board of Directors shall have the right, at
     any time and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or
     all of the provisions of the Plan and the Trust Agreement (except
     Section 8.4 of the Plan, which shall not be amended except as provided
     therein), provided that no amendment shall authorize or permit any
     part of the Trust Fund to be used for or diverted to purposes other
     than for the exclusive benefit of the Participants or their
     Beneficiaries, or permit any portion of the Trust Fund to revert to or
     become the property of any Employer, except as may be required to
     obtain or retain qualification, or as permitted, under Section 401(a)
     of the Internal Revenue Code or to be a Plan described in Sections
     301(d) and 301(e) of the Tax Reduction Act, Section 331 of the
     Economic Recovery Tax Act and Section 409 of the Internal Revenue Code
     and that no amendment shall deprive any Participant or any Beneficiary
     of a deceased Participant of any of the benefits or of an optional
     form of benefit to which he is entitled under this Plan with respect
     to contributions previously made, nor shall any amendment decrease any
     Participant's Accounts provided that no amendment made in conformance
     to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or any other statute
     relating to employee's trusts, or any official regulations or rulings
     issued pursuant thereto, shall be considered prejudicial to the rights
     of any Participant or Beneficiary.  No amendment which affects the
     rights, duties or responsibilities of the Trust may be made without
     the Trustee's written consent.

          The Committee shall have the same authority with respect to the
     adoption of amendments to the Plan and Trust Agreement as the Board of
     Directors in the following circumstances:

               (a)  to adopt amendments to the Plan which the Committee
          determines are necessary or desirable for the Plan to comply with
          or to obtain benefits or advantages under the provisions of
          applicable law, regulations or rulings or requirements of the<PAGE>
          Internal Revenue Service or other government administrative
          agency or changes in such law, regulations, rulings or
          requirements; and

               (b)  to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic amendment
          that the Committee determines to be necessary or desirable that
          does not materially change benefits to Participants or their
          Beneficiaries or materially increase the Employer's contributions
          to the Plan.

          The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by the
     Committee to the Board of Directors on a timely basis.

          8.2  Termination of Plan By the Company.  Although it is the
     intention of the Company that this Plan be permanent, the Company
     reserves the right to terminate the Plan and the Trust at any time, by
     delivering to the Committee, the Trustee and each Employer hereunder,
     written notice thereof.

          Upon termination of the Plan or permanent discontinuance of
     Employer Contributions to the Plan, the interest of each Participant
     and Beneficiary in his Accounts shall remain fully vested, but shall
     be subject to readjustment as provided in Section 4.2 hereof.  In the
     event of termination of this Plan, the Board of Directors may direct
     that the Trustee continue the Trust for a specified period of time, or
     for such period of time as the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may
     deem to be in the best interest of the Participants or their
     Beneficiaries.  In the absence of specific direction from the Board of
     Directors, the Trust assets shall be distributed by the Trustee in
     shares of common stock of the Company.  Notwithstanding the provision
     of this Section, no distributions shall be made to any Participant of
     any assets which have been allocated to the Participant's Account for
     less than eighty-four (84) months following the month in which such
     assets were allocated to the Participant's Account, unless the
     Participant shall have a separation from service as defined in Section
     409(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, except as otherwise permitted in
     Section 10.6.

          Upon the partial termination of the Plan, the interest of each
     Participant whose employment is terminated on account of (or who
     otherwise suffers such) partial termination shall remain fully vested.
     Sales of McDonald's Restaurants by the Company or another Employee
     will not constitute a partial termination unless such sale under all
     other facts and circumstances constitutes a partial termination.  In
     the absence of specific direction from the Board of Directors, the
     Trust assets shall be distributed by the Trustee in shares of Company
     Stock.

          8.3  Merger, Consolidation, or Transfer of Assets. This Plan
     shall not be merged or consolidated with, nor shall any assets or
     liabilities be transferred to, any other plan, unless the benefits
     payable to each Participant, if the Plan were terminated immediately
     after such action, would be not less than the benefits which would
     have been payable to each such Participant if the Plan had been
     terminated immediately before such action.

          8.4  Put Option Requirement.  If any common stock of the Company
     allocated to a Participant's Accounts, except the Participant's<PAGE>
     Additional Employer Contribution Account, under the Plan (the "Tax
     Credit Employer Security") is not publicly traded when distributed, or
     thereafter ceases to be publicly traded (or becomes subject to a
     trading limitation), the distributee shall be given an option
     exercisable only by the distributee (or the distributee's donees or a
     person, including an estate of a distributee, to whom the Tax Credit
     Employer Security passes by reason of the Participant's death), to put
     the Tax Credit Employer Security to the Company for a 15-month period
     beginning on the date of distribution.  If such Tax Credit Employer
     Security ceases to be publicly traded (or becomes subject to a trading
     limitation) within 15 months after the distribution, the Company shall
     notify the Participant in writing on or before the 10th day after the
     date the Tax Credit Employer Security ceased to be publicly traded (or
     became subject to a trading limitation) that the Tax Credit Employer
     Security is subject to a put option to the Company for the remainder
     of the 15-month period (or, if such notice is given after the 10th day
     after the Tax Credit Employer Security ceases to be publicly traded,
     for a period equal to the remainder of the 15-month period plus a
     number of days equal to the number of days between such 10th day and
     the date on which such notice is actually given), and such notice
     shall inform the distributees of the terms of the put option.  The
     Plan shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the
     rights and obligations of the Company with respect to the put option
     at the time the put option is exercised.  A put option hereunder shall
     be exercised by the holder notifying the Company in writing that the
     put option is being exercised.  The period during which the put option
     is exercisable shall be extended by the duration of any time period
     when a distributee is unable to exercise it because the Company is
     prohibited from honoring it under applicable Federal or State law.  A
     put option shall be exercisable at a price equal to the value of the
     Tax Credit Employer Security determined as of the most recent
     Valuation Date.  Payment under a put option shall not be restricted by
     the provisions of a loan or other arrangement, including the Company's
     articles of incorporation, unless so required by State law.
     Provisions for a payment under any put option shall be reasonable.
     Payments may be deferred only if adequate security and a reasonable
     rate of interest are provided and if periodic payments are made in
     substantially equal installments beginning within 30 days after the
     date the put option is exercised and extending for no more than 5
     years after the put option is exercised.

          The provisions of this Section 8.4 shall not be terminated or
     amended except to the extent required or permitted under applicable
     law, Treasury Regulations and Rulings of the Internal Revenue Service.

                                   SECTION IX

                              Top Heavy Provisions

          9.1  Application. The definitions in Section 9.2 shall apply
     under this Section IX and the special rules in Section 9.3 shall
     apply, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, for any Plan
     Year in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan and for such other Plan
     Years as may be specified herein.

          9.2  Special Top Heavy Definitions.  The following special
     definitions shall apply under this Section IX.<PAGE>

               (a)  "Aggregate Employer Contributions" means the sum of all
          Employer Contributions and Forfeitures under this Plan allocated
          for a Participant to the Plan and employer contributions and
          forfeitures allocated for the Participant to all Related Defined
          Contribution Plans in the Aggregation Group; provided, however,
          that for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 1985, employer
          contributions attributable to salary reduction or similar
          arrangement which complies with Section 401(k) of the Internal
          Revenue Code ("Salary Reduction Contributions") under any Related
          Defined Contribution Plans shall not be included in Aggregate
          Employer Contributions and further provided that for Plan Years
          which began after December 31, 1988, Salary Reduction
          Contributions made under any Related Plan and any employer
          contributions to such Plan which match Salary Reduction
          Contributions.

               (b)  "Aggregation Group" means the group of plans in a
          Mandatory Aggregation Group, if any, that includes the Plan,
          unless inclusion of Related Plans in the Permissive Aggregation
          Group in the Aggregation Group would prevent the Plan from being
          a Top Heavy Plan, in which case "Aggregation Group" means the
          group of plans consisting of the Plan and each other Related Plan
          in a Permissive Aggregation Group with the Plan.

                    (1)  "Mandatory Aggregation Group" means each plan
               (considering the Plan and Related Plans) that, during the
               Plan Year that contains the Determination Date or any of the
               four preceding Plan Years,

                         (A)  had a participant who was a Key Employee, or

                         (B)  was necessary to be considered with a plan in
                    which a Key Employee participated in order to enable
                    the plan in which the Key Employee participated to meet
                    the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410
                    of the Internal Revenue Code.

                    If the Plan is not described in (A) or (B) above, it
               shall not be part of a Mandatory Aggregation Group.

                    (2)  "Permissive Aggregation Group" means the group of
               plans consisting of (A) the plans, if any, in a Mandatory
               Aggregation Group with the Plan, and (B) any other Related
               Plan, that, when considered as a part of the Aggregation
               Group, does not cause the Aggregation Group to fail to
               satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and Section
               410 of the Internal Revenue Code.  A Related Plan in (B) of
               the preceding sentence may include a simplified employee
               pension plan, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section
               408(k), and a collectively bargained plan, if when
               considered as a part of the Aggregation Group such plan does
               not cause the Aggregation Group to fail to satisfy the
               requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410 of the
               Internal Revenue Code considering, if the plan is a
               multiemployer plan as described in Internal Revenue Code
               Section 414(f) or a multiple employer plan as described in
               Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c), benefits under the
               plan only to the extent provided to employees of the<PAGE>
               employer because of service with the employer and, if the
               plan is a simplified employee pension plan, only the
               employer's contribution to the plan.

               (c)  "Determination Date" means, with respect to a Plan
          Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year or, in the case of
          the first Plan Year, the last day of such Plan Year.  If the Plan
          is aggregated with other plans in the Aggregation Group, the
          Determination Date for each other plan shall be, with respect to
          any Plan Year, the Determination Date for each such other plan
          which falls in the same calendar year as the Determination Date
          for the Plan.

               (d)  "Key Employee" means, for the Plan Year containing the
          Determination Date, any person or the beneficiary of any person
          who is an employee or former employee of an Employer or a
          Commonly Controlled Entity as determined under Internal Revenue
          Code Section 416(i) and who, at any time during the Plan Year
          containing the Determination Date or any of the four (4)
          preceding Plan Years (the "Measurement Period"), is a person
          described in paragraph (1), (2), (3) or (4), subject to
          paragraph (5).

                    (1)  An officer of the Employer or Commonly Controlled
               Entity who:

                         (A)  in any Measurement Period, in the case of a
                    Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1983, is an
                    officer during the Plan Year and has annual
                    Compensation for the Plan Year in an amount greater
                    than fifty percent (50%) of the amount in effect under
                    Section 415(b)(1)(A) of Internal Revenue Code for the
                    calendar year in which such Plan Year ends ($30,000 in
                    1989, adjusted in subsequent years as determined in
                    accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
                    of the Treasury or his delegate pursuant to the
                    provisions of Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue
                    Code); and

                         (B)  in any Measurement Period, in the case of a
                    Plan Year beginning on or before December 1, 1983, is
                    an officer during the Plan Year, regardless of his
                    Compensation (except to the extent that applicable law,
                    regulations and rulings indicate that the compensation
                    requirement set forth in subparagraph (A) above is
                    applicable).

                    No more than a total of fifty (50) persons (or, if
               lesser, the greater of three (3) persons or ten percent
               (10%) of all persons or beneficiaries of persons who are
               employees or former employees) shall be treated as Key
               Employees under this paragraph (1) for any Measurement
               Period.  In the case of an Employer or Commonly Controlled
               Entity which is not a corporation (I) in any Measurement
               Period, in the case of a Plan Year beginning on or before
               February 28, 1985 no persons shall be treated as Key
               Employees under this paragraph (1); and (II) in any
               Measurement Period, in the case of a Plan Year beginning<PAGE>
               after February 28, 1985, the term "officer" as used in this
               subsection (d) shall include administrative executives as
               described in Section 1.416-1(T-13) of the Treasury
               Regulations.

                    (2)  One (1) of the ten (10) persons who, during a Plan
               Year in the Measurement Period:

                         (A)  have annual Compensation from the Employer or
                    a Commonly Controlled Entity for such Plan Year greater
                    than the amount in effect under Section 415(c)(1)(A) of
                    the Internal Revenue Code for the calendar year in
                    which such Plan Year ends ($30,000 for 1989 or one-
                    fourth of the dollar limitation in effect under Section
                    415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted in
                    subsequent years as determined in accordance with
                    regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury
                    or his delegate pursuant to the provisions of Section
                    415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code); and

                         (B)  own (or are considered as owning within the
                    meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) in such
                    Plan Year, the largest percentage interests in the
                    Employer or a Commonly Controlled Entity, in such Plan
                    Year, provided that no person shall be treated as a Key
                    Employee under this paragraph unless he owns more than
                    one-half percent (1/2%) interest in the Employer or a
                    Commonly Controlled Entity.

                    No more than a total of ten (10) persons or
               beneficiaries of persons who are employees or former
               employees shall be treated as Key Employees under this
               paragraph (2) for any Measurement Period.

                    (3)  A person who, for a Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, is a more than five percent (5%) owner (or is
               considered as owning more than five percent (5%) within the
               meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) of the
               Employer or a Commonly Controlled Entity.

                    (4)  A person who, for a Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, is a more than one percent (1%) owner (or is
               considered as owning more than one percent (1%) within the
               meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) of the
               Employer or a Commonly Controlled Entity and has an annual
               Compensation for such Plan Year from the Employer and
               Commonly Controlled Entities of more than $150,000.

                    (5)  If the number of persons who meet the requirements
               to be treated as Key Employees under paragraph (1) or (2)
               exceed the limitation on the number of Key Employees to be
               counted under paragraph (1) or (2), those persons with the
               highest annual Compensation in a Plan Year in the
               Measurement Period for which the requirements are met and
               who are within the limitation on the number of Key Employees
               will be treated as Key Employees.<PAGE>

                    If the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) are met by
               a person in more than one (1) Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, each person will be counted only once under
               paragraph (1) or (2):

                         (A)  under paragraph (1), the Plan Year in the
                    Measurement Period in which a person who was an officer
                    and had the highest annual Compensation shall be used
                    to determine whether the person will be treated as a
                    Key Employee under the preceding sentence;

                         (B)  under paragraph (2), the Plan Year in the
                    Measurement Period in which the ownership percentage
                    interest is the greatest shall be used to determine
                    whether the person will be treated as a Key Employee
                    under the preceding sentence.

                    Notwithstanding the above provisions of paragraph (5),
               a person may be counted in determining the limitation under
               both paragraphs (1) and (2).  In determining the sum of the
               Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key Employees under
               subsection (h) of this Section, the Present Value of Accrued
               Benefits for any person shall be counted only once.

               (e)  "Non-Key Employee" means (i) a person or the
          beneficiary of a person with an account balance in the Plan or an
          account balance or accrued benefit in any Related Plan in the
          Aggregation Group or (ii) an employee, a former employee or the
          beneficiary of such person who has received a distribution during
          the Measurement Period and (iii) who during the Measurement
          Period is not a Key Employee.

               (f)  "Present Value of Accrued Benefits" means, for any Plan
          Year, an amount equal to the sum of (1), (2) and (3) for each
          person who, in the Plan Year containing the Determination Date,
          was a Key Employee or a Non-Key Employee and, further provided
          that the accrued benefit of any Non-Key Employee shall be
          determined under the method which is used for accrual purposes
          for all Related Defined Benefit Plans or, if no single accrual
          method is used in all such plans, such accrued benefit shall be
          determined as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly than the
          slowest accrual rate permitted under Section 411(b)(1)(C) of the
          Internal Revenue Code.

                    (1)  Subject to (4) below, the value of a person's
               Accounts under the Plan and each Related Defined
               Contribution Plan in the Aggregation Group, determined as of
               the valuation date coincident with or immediately preceding
               the Determination Date, adjusted for contributions due as of
               the Determination Date, as follows:

                         (A)  in the case of a plan not subject to the
                    minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the
                    Internal Revenue Code, by including the amount of any
                    contributions actually made after the valuation date
                    but on or before the Determination Date, and, in the
                    first plan year of a plan, by including contributions<PAGE>
                    made after the Determination Date that are allocated as
                    of a date in that first plan year; and

                         (B)  in the case of a plan that is subject to the
                    minimum funding requirements, by including the amount
                    of any contributions that would be allocated as of a
                    date not later than the Determination Date, plus
                    adjustments to those amounts as required under
                    applicable rulings, even though those amounts are not
                    yet required to be contributed or allocated (e.g.,
                    because they have been waived) and by including the
                    amount of any contributions actually made (or due to be
                    made) after the valuation date but before the
                    expiration of the extended payment period in
                    Section 412(c)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.

                    (2)  Subject to (4) below, the sum of the actuarial
               present values of a person's accrued benefits under each
               Related Defined Benefit Plan in the Aggregation Group,
               expressed as a benefit commencing at normal retirement date
               (or the person's attained age, if later) determined based on
               the following actuarial assumptions:

                         (A)  Interest rate 5%; and

                         (B)  Post Retirement Mortality: 1984 Unisex
                    Pension Table;

               and determined in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
               Section 416(g), provided, however, that if a defined benefit
               plan in the Aggregation Group provides for different or
               additional actuarial assumptions to be used in determining
               the present value of accrued benefits thereunder for the
               purpose of determining the top heavy status thereof, then
               such different or additional actuarial assumptions shall
               apply with respect to each defined benefit plan in the
               Aggregation Group.

                    The present value of an accrued benefit for any person
               who is employed by an employer maintaining a plan on the
               Determination Date is determined as of the most recent
               valuation date which is within a 12-month period ending on
               the Determination Date, provided however that:

                         (C)  for the first plan year of the plan, the
                    present value for an employee is determined as if the
                    employee had a Termination of Service (1) on the
                    Determination Date or (2) on such valuation date but
                    taking into account the estimated accrued benefit as of
                    the Determination Date; and

                         (D)  for the second and subsequent plan years of
                    the plan, the accrued benefit taken into account for an
                    employee is not less than the accrued benefit taken
                    into account for the first plan year unless the
                    difference is attributable to using an estimate of the
                    accrued benefit as of the Determination Date for the<PAGE>
                    first plan year and using the actual accrued benefit as
                    of the Determination Date for the second plan year.

                    For purposes of this paragraph (2), the valuation date
               is the valuation date used by the plan for computing plan
               costs for minimum funding, regardless of whether a valuation
               is performed that year.

                    If the plan provides for a nonproportional subsidy as
               described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.416-1 (T-27),
               the present value of accrued benefits shall be determined
               taking into account the value of nonproportional subsidized
               early retirement benefits and nonproportional subsidized
               benefit options.

                    (3)  Subject to (4) below, the aggregate value of
               amounts distributed during the plan year that includes the
               Determination Date or any of the four preceding plan years
               including amounts distributed under a terminated plan which,
               if it had not been terminated, would have been in the
               Aggregation Group.

                    (4)  The following rules shall apply in determining the
               Present Value of Accrued Benefits:

                         (A)  Amounts attributable to qualified voluntary
                    employee contributions, as defined in Section 219(e) of
                    the Internal Revenue Code, shall be excluded.

                         (B)  In computing the Present Value of Accrued
                    Benefits with respect to rollovers or plan-to-plan
                    transfers, the following rules shall be applied to
                    determine whether amounts which have been distributed
                    during the five (5) year period ending on the
                    Determination Date from or accepted into this Plan or
                    any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be included in
                    determining the Present Value of Accrued Benefits:

                              (i)   Unrelated Transfers accepted into the
                         Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group after
                         December 31, 1983 shall not be included.

                              (ii)  Unrelated Transfers accepted on or
                         before December 31, 1983 and all Related Transfers
                         accepted at any time into the Plan or any plan in
                         the Aggregation Group shall be included.

                              (iii) Unrelated Transfers made from the Plan
                         or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be
                         included.

                              (iv)  Related Transfers made from the Plan or
                         any plan in the Aggregation Group shall not be
                         included by the transferor plan (but shall be
                         counted by the accepting plan).

                    The accrued benefit of any individual who has not
               received any Compensation from an Employer maintaining the<PAGE>
               Plan at any time during the five (5) year period ending on
               the Determination Date shall be excluded in computing the
               Present Value of Accrued Benefits.

               (g)  "Related Transfer" means a rollover or a plan-to-plan
          transfer which is either not initiated by the Employee or is made
          between plans each of which is maintained by a Commonly
          Controlled Entity.

               (h)  A "Top Heavy Aggregation Group" means an Aggregation
          Group in any Plan Year for which, as of the Determination Date,
          the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key
          Employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group exceeds sixty
          percent (60%) of the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits
          for all employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group;
          provided that, for purposes of determining the sum of Present
          Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees, former Key Employees
          who have not performed any services for an Employer or a Commonly
          Controlled Entity in the Plan Year containing the Determination
          Date at the preceding four Plan Years shall be excluded entirely
          from the calculation of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for
          the Plan Year that contains the Determination Date.  For purposes
          of applying the special rules herein with respect to a Super Top
          Heavy Plan, a Top Heavy Aggregation Group will also constitute a
          "Super Top Heavy Aggregation Group" if in any Plan Year as of the
          Determination Date, the sum of the Present Value of Accrued
          Benefits for Key Employees under all plans in the Aggregation
          Group exceeds ninety percent (90%) of the sum of the Present
          Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees under all plans in
          the Aggregation Group.

               (i)  "Top Heavy Plan" means the Plan in any Plan Year in
          which it is a member of a Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including
          a Top Heavy Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Plan.  For
          purposes of applying the rules herein with respect to a Super Top
          Heavy Plan, a Top Heavy Plan will also constitute a "Super Top
          Heavy Plan" if the Plan in any Plan Year is a member of a Super
          Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including a Super Top Heavy
          Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Plan.

               (j)  "Unrelated Transfer" means a rollover or a plan-to-plan
          transfer which is both initiated by the Employee and (a) made
          from a plan maintained by a Commonly Controlled Entity to a plan
          maintained by an employer which is not a Commonly Controlled
          Entity or (b) made to a plan maintained by a Commonly Controlled
          Entity from a plan maintained by an employer which is not a
          Commonly Controlled Entity.

          9.3  Special Top Heavy Provisions.  For each Plan Year in which
     the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan, the following rules shall apply, except
     that the special provisions of this Section 9.3 shall not apply with
     respect to any employee included in a unit of employees covered by an
     agreement which the Secretary of Labor finds to be a
     collective-bargaining agreement between employee representatives and
     one or more employees if there is evidence that retirement benefits
     were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee
     representative and the Employer or Employers:<PAGE>

               (a)  Minimum Employer Contributions.

                    (1)   For any Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top
               Heavy Plan, the Employers shall make additional Employer
               Contributions to the Plan as necessary for each Participant
               who is employed on the last day of the Plan Year and who is
               a Non-Key Employee to bring the amount of his Aggregate
               Employer Contributions for the Plan Year up to at least
               three percent (3%) of his Compensation, or if the Plan is
               not required to be included in an aggregation group in order
               to permit a defined benefit plan in the aggregation group to
               satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) or Section 410
               of the Internal Revenue Code, such lesser amount as is equal
               to the largest percentage of a Key Employee's Compensation
               (as limited in accordance with Section 9.3(c)) allocated to
               the Key Employee as Aggregate Employer Contributions.

                    (2)  For purposes of determining whether a Non-Key
               Employee is a Participant entitled to have minimum Employer
               Contributions made on his behalf, a Non-Key Employee will be
               treated as a Participant even if he is not otherwise a
               Participant (or accrues no benefit) under the Plan because:

                         (A)  he has failed to complete the requisite
                    number of hours of service (if any) after becoming a
                    Participant in the Plan,

                         (B)  he is excluded from participation in the Plan
                    (or accrues no benefit) merely because his compensation
                    is less than a stated amount, or

                         (C)  he is excluded from participation in the Plan
                    (or accrues no benefit) merely because of a failure to
                    make mandatory employee contributions or, if the Plan
                    is a Plan described in Section 401(k) of the Internal
                    Revenue Code, because of a failure to make elective
                    401(k) contributions.

               (b)  Vesting.  For each Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top
          Heavy Plan and for each Plan Year thereafter, the vested right of
          each Participant who has an Hour of Service after the Plan
          becomes a Top Heavy Plan to a percentage of his Accrued Benefit
          to the extent the Accrued Benefit had not been forfeited prior to
          the Plan's becoming a Top Heavy Plan shall remain fully vested
          and nonforfeitable.

               (c)  Top Heavy Limitations.

                    (1)  In computing the limitations under Section 3.6
               hereof, if the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan and is not a Super
               Top Heavy Plan, the special rules of Section 416(h) of the
               Internal Revenue Code shall be applied in accordance with
               applicable regulations and rulings so that

                         (A)  in determining the denominator of the Defined
                    Contribution Plan Fraction and the Defined Benefit Plan
                    Fraction, at each place at which "1.25" would have been
                    used, "1.00" shall be substituted and<PAGE>

                         (B)  in determining the numerator of the
                    transition fraction described in Section 415(e)(6)(B)
                    of the Internal Revenue Code by substituting $41,500
                    for $51,875,

                    unless the special requirements of Section 416(h)(2) of
               the Internal Revenue Code have been satisfied.

                    (2)  In computing the limitations under Section 3.6
               hereof, if the Plan is a Super Top Heavy Plan, the special
               rules of Section 416(h) of the Code shall be applied in
               accordance with applicable regulations and rulings so that

                         (A)  in determining the denominator of the Defined
                    Contribution Plan Fraction and the Defined Benefit Plan
                    Fraction, at each place at which "1.25" would have been
                    used, "1.00" shall be substituted and

                         (B)  in determining the numerator of the
                    transitional fraction described in Section 415(e)(6)(B)
                    of the Internal Revenue Code $41,500 shall be
                    substituted for $51,875.

               (d)  Transition Rule for a Top Heavy Plan.  Notwithstanding
          the provisions of Section 9.3(c), for each Plan Year in which the
          Plan is a Top Heavy Plan and in which the Plan does not meet the
          special requirements of Section 416(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue
          Code in order to use 1.25 in the denominator of the Defined
          Contribution Plan Fraction and the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction,
          if an Employee was a participant in one or more defined benefit
          plans and in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by
          the employer before the plans became Top Heavy Plans and if such
          Participant's Combined Fraction exceeds 1.00 because of accruals
          and additions that were made before the plans became Top Heavy
          Plans, a factor equal to the lesser of 1.25 or such lesser amount
          (but not less than 1.00) as shall be needed to make the
          Employee's Combined Fraction equal to 1.00 shall be used in the
          denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the Defined
          Contribution Plan Fraction if there are no further accruals or
          annual additions under any Top Heavy Plans until the
          Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater than 1.00 when a
          factor of 1.00 is used in the denominators of the Defined Benefit
          Plan Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction.  Any
          provisions herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Plan is
          a Top Heavy Plan and the Plan does not meet the special
          requirements of Section 416(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code in
          order to use 1.25 in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan
          Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction, there shall
          be no further Annual Additions for a Participant whose Combined
          Fraction is greater than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used in
          the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the
          Defined Contribution Plan Fraction, until such time as the
          Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater than 1.00.

               (e)  Transition Rule for a Super Top Heavy Plan.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 9.3(c) and 9.3(d), for
          each Plan Year in which the Plan is a Super Top Heavy Plan, (1)<PAGE>
          if an Employee was a participant in one or more defined benefit
          plans and in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by
          the employer before the plans became Super Top Heavy Plans, and
          (2) if such Participant's Combined Fraction exceeds 1.00 because
          of accruals and additions that were made before the plans became
          Super Top Heavy Plans and if immediately before the plans became
          Super Top Heavy Plans the Combined Fraction as then computed did
          not exceed 1.00, then a factor equal to the lesser of 1.25 or
          such lesser amount (but not less than 1.00) as shall be needed to
          make the Employee's Combined Fraction equal to 1.00 shall be used
          in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the
          Defined Contribution Plan Fraction if there are no further
          accruals or annual additions under any Super Top Heavy Plans
          until the Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater than
          1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used in the denominators of the
          Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan
          Fraction.  Any provisions herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
          if the Plan is a Super Top Heavy Plan, there shall be no further
          Annual Additions for a Participant whose Combined Fraction is
          greater than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used in the
          denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the Defined
          Contribution Plan Fraction until the Participant's Combined
          Fraction is not greater than 1.00.

               (f)  Terminated Plan.  If the Plan becomes a Top Heavy Plan
          after it has formally been terminated, has ceased crediting for
          benefit accruals and vesting and has been or is distributing all
          plan assets to participants and their beneficiaries as soon as
          administratively feasible or if a terminated plan has distributed
          all benefits of participants and their beneficiaries, the
          provisions of Section 11.3 shall not apply to the Plan.

               (g)  Frozen Plans.  If the Plan becomes a Top Heavy Plan
          after contributions have ceased under the Plan but all assets
          have not been distributed to Participants or their beneficiaries,
          the provisions of Section 9.3 shall apply to the Plan.

                                   SECTION X

                            Miscellaneous Provisions

          10.1 Headings.  Headings of sections and subsections of the Plan
     are inserted for convenience of reference and are not part of the Plan
     and are not to be considered in the construction thereof.

          10.2 Indemnification.  The Company shall indemnify and hold
     harmless each member of the Committee, each member of the Board of
     Directors, each individual Trustee and each and every employee of the
     Company or of a Commonly Controlled Entity, its Subsidiaries or
     Affiliates to whom are delegated duties, responsibilities and
     authority with respect to the Plan and the Trust against all claims,
     liabilities, fines and penalties and all expenses reasonably incurred
     by or imposed upon him (including but not limited to reasonable
     attorney fees) which arise as a result of his actions or failure to
     act in connection with the operation and administration of the Plan
     and the Trust to the extent lawfully allowable and to the extent that
     such claim, liability, fine, penalty or expense is not paid for by
     liability insurance purchased by or paid for by the Company.<PAGE>
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not indemnify any
     person for any such amount incurred through any settlement or
     compromise of any action unless the Company consents in writing to
     such settlement or compromise.  Expenses incurred in defending a civil
     or criminal suit or proceeding may be paid by the Company in advance
     of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as
     authorized by the Company in the specific case upon receipt of an
     undertaking by or on behalf of the member of the Committee, member of
     the Board of Directors, each individual Trustee or employee of the
     Company or of a Commonly Controlled Entity, its Subsidiary, or
     Affiliate, to repay such amount, unless it shall ultimately be
     determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Company as
     authorized in this Section 10.2.

          10.3 Employees' Trust.  This Plan is created for the exclusive
     purpose of providing benefits to the Participants in the Plan and
     their Beneficiaries, and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
     with its being a Plan described in Sections 401(a) and 409 of the
     Internal Revenue Code, Sections 301(d) and 301(e) of the Tax Reduction
     Act and Section 331 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act, and the Trust
     exempt under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

          10.4 Nonalienation of Benefits.

               (a)  Benefits payable under this Plan shall not be subject
          in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer,
          assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution
          or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, prior to
          actually being received by the person entitled to the benefit
          under the terms of the Plan; and any attempt to anticipate,
          alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge,
          garnish, execute on, levy or otherwise dispose of any right to
          benefits payable hereunder, shall be void.  The Trust Fund shall
          not in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts,
          contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person
          entitled to benefits hereunder.  The foregoing provisions of this
          Section 10.4(a) shall not preclude the (1) enforcement of a
          Federal tax levy made pursuant to Section 6331 of the Internal
          Revenue Code or (2) collection by the United States on a judgment
          resulting from an unpaid tax assessment.

               (b)  Notwithstanding Section 10.4(a), the Trustee

                    (1)  shall comply with an order entered on or after
               January 1, 1985 determined by the Plan Administrator to be a
               Qualified Domestic Relations Order as provided in
               Section 10.5,

                    (2)  shall comply with a domestic relations order
               entered before January 1, 1985 if benefits are already being
               paid under such order, and

                    (3)  may treat an order entered before January 1, 1985
               as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order even if it does not
               meet the requirements of Section 10.5.

          10.5 Qualified Domestic Relations Order.<PAGE>

               (a)  "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" means any
          judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property
          settlement agreement)

                    (1)  which is made pursuant to a state domestic
               relations law (including a community property law),

                    (2)  which relates to the provision of child support,
               alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse,
               former spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant,

                    (3)  which creates or recognizes the existence of an
               alternate payee's right to or assigns to an alternate payee
               the right to receive all or a portion of the Participant's
               Accounts under the Plan, and

                    (4)  with respect to which the requirements of
               paragraphs (b) and (c) are met.

               (b)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order only if such order clearly specifies

                    (1)  the name and the last known mailing address, if
               any, of the Participant and the name and mailing address of
               each alternate payee covered by the order;

                    (2)  the amount or percentage of the Participant's
               Accrued Benefit to be paid by the Plan to each such
               alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or
               percentage is to be determined;

                    (3)  the number of payments or period to which such
               order applies; and

                    (4)  each Plan Year to which such order applies.

               (c)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order only if such order does not

                    (1)  require the Plan to provide any type or form of
               benefit, or any option not otherwise provided under the
               Plan,

                    (2)  require the Plan to provide increased benefits
               (determined on the basis of actuarial value), or

                    (3)  require the payment of benefits to an alternate
               payee which are required to be paid to another alternate
               payee under another order previously determined to be a
               Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

               If so ordered under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, a
          distribution shall be made of shares of Company Stock held in the
          Participant's Unmatched Employer Contribution Account, Employer
          Matching Contribution Account, Participant Contribution Account
          and PAYSOP Employer Contribution Account for less than 84 months
          following the month in which such shares were allocated to his
          Accounts.<PAGE>

               (d)  In the case of any payment before a Participant has had
          a Termination of Service, a domestic relations order shall not be
          treated as failing to meet the requirements of Section 10.5(c)(1)
          solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be
          made to an alternate payee

                    (1)  (A)  Effective for periods before January 1, 1993
               on or after the date on which the Participant attains (or
               would have attained) the age which is ten years before the
               Normal Retirement Date under the Plan, and

                    (B)  Effective for periods on or after January 1, 1993,
               without regard to the Participant's attainment of any
               specified age; provided that until an IRS determination
               letter is received stating that the Plan as amended by this
               provision is qualified, no common stock of the Company which
               has been held in a Participant's Account for less than 84
               months shall be distributed pursuant to a QDRO to an
               alternate payee with respect to a Participant who is both
               under age 50 and not otherwise eligible to receive a
               distribution under the Plan.

                    (2)  as if the Participant had retired on the date on
               which such payment is to begin under such order, and

                    (3)  in any form in which such benefits may be paid
               under the Plan to the Participant.

               (e)  To the extent provided in a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order, the former spouse of a Participant shall be
          treated as the surviving spouse of such Participant for the
          purposes of Section 5.3.

          10.6 Exception to Distribution Limitation Period.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan regarding limitations
     on the period of distribution of Trust Fund assets, the distribution
     limitation period restrictions imposed by Internal Revenue Code
     Section 409(d) with respect to distribution of Trust Fund assets from
     a Participant's Account shall not apply to assets which have been
     allocated to a Participant's Account in the event of:

               (a)  a transfer of the Participant to the employment of an
          acquiring employer from the employment of an Employer upon the
          sale by the Employer to the acquiring employer of (i)
          substantially all of the assets used by the Employer in a trade
          or business conducted by the Employer; or (ii) the sale of
          substantially all of the stock of a subsidiary of the Employer;
          or

               (b)  with respect to the stock of the Employer, a
          disposition of the Employer's interest in a subsidiary where the
          Participant continues employment with such subsidiary.

          10.7 Unclaimed Amounts.

               (a)  Effective for periods before January 1, 1990, unclaimed
          amounts shall consist of the amounts of the Accounts of a<PAGE>
          retired, deceased or terminated Participant which are not
          distributed because of the Committee's inability, after a
          reasonable search, to locate a Participant or his Beneficiary
          within a period of two years after the payment of benefits
          becomes due.  Subject to Section 4.8, unclaimed amounts for a
          Plan Year shall be allocated as provided in Section 3.3(d) as
          Additional Employer Contributions for the Plan Year in which such
          two-year period shall end.  If an Unclaimed Amount is
          subsequently properly claimed by the Participant or the
          Participant's Beneficiary, said amount shall be paid to such
          Participant or Beneficiary by treating such amount as an expense
          of all Participants' Additional Employer Contribution Accounts
          during the Plan Year in which the Participant or Beneficiary
          makes such claim, unless the Company in its discretion makes a
          contribution to the Plan for such Plan Year in an amount
          sufficient to pay such amount.

               (b)  Effective for periods on or after January 1, 1990,
          unclaimed amounts shall consist of the amounts of the Accounts of
          a retired, deceased or terminated Participant which are not
          distributed because of the Committee's inability, after a
          reasonable search, to locate a Participant or his Beneficiary
          within a period of two years after the payment of benefits
          becomes due.  As of the last day of the Plan Year in which such
          two-year period shall end, and as of the last day of each
          succeeding Plan Year in which there remain any Unclaimed Amounts,
          each Account which contains Unclaimed Amounts shall be reduced by
          an amount ("Forfeiture"), as determined hereinafter, which
          Forfeiture shall be applied (i) to restore any prior years'
          Forfeitures of Unclaimed Amounts which are properly claimed by a
          Participant or by a Participant's Beneficiary during such Plan
          Year and (ii) to pay any expenses of the Plan or Trust incurred
          during such Plan Year.  The total amount of Forfeitures from
          Unclaimed Amounts for each Plan Year shall be equal to the sum of
          (A) prior years' Forfeitures from Unclaimed Amounts which are
          properly claimed by a Participant or by a Participant's
          Beneficiary during such Plan Year and are not paid from
          contributions made to the Plan by the Company for such Plan Year
          and (B) expenses of the Plan incurred during such Plan Year that
          are not paid by the Company.  Forfeitures for each Plan Year
          shall come first from those Unclaimed Amounts which have remained
          in the Trust for the greatest period of time since first becoming
          Unclaimed Amounts, and thereafter from Unclaimed Amounts in
          descending order of maturity.  If a Forfeiture of Unclaimed
          Amounts is subsequently properly claimed by the Participant or
          the Participant's Beneficiary, said amount shall be paid to the
          Participant or Beneficiary from Forfeitures for the Plan Year in
          which the Participant or Beneficiary makes such claim, as
          provided in this Section 10.7, or, to the extent such current
          year's Forfeitures are not sufficient, from contributions made to
          the Plan by the Company for such purpose.

               Subject to receipt of a favorable determination by the
          Internal Revenue Service that the application of Forfeitures
          pursuant to the provisions of this sentence will not adversely
          affect the qualification of the Plan as a tax credit employee
          stock ownership plan within the meaning of Section 409(a) of the
          Internal Revenue Code or, alternatively, that the Plan, as<PAGE>
          amended to provide for the application of Forfeitures pursuant to
          the provisions of this sentence, continues to qualify as a tax
          credit employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of
          Section 409(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, Forfeitures of
          Unclaimed Amounts may be applied to the payment of Plan expenses
          pursuant to this Section 10.7 without regard to the limitations
          on reimbursement for expenses prescribed by Section 409(i) of the
          Internal Revenue Code.

          10.8 Invalidity of Certain Provisions.  If any provision of this
     Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
     unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof and this
     Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions had not
     been included.

          10.9 Gender and Number.  Except when otherwise indicated by the
     context, any masculine terminology herein shall also include the
     feminine and the singular shall also include the plural.

          10.10     Law Governing.  This Plan and Trust shall be construed
     and enforced according to the laws of the State of Illinois other than
     its laws respecting choice of law, to the extent not preempted by
     ERISA.

                                                              Exhibit 10(g)


                             McDONALD'S CORPORATION
                            DEFERRED INCENTIVE PLAN
          (As Amended and Restated Effective as of September 1, 1994)


                                   Section 1
                                  Introduction

          1.1  The Plan and Its Effective Date.  The McDonald's Corporation
     Deferred Incentive Plan ("Plan") was established November 1, 1993.
     The effective date of the amendment and restatement of the Plan as set
     forth herein is September 1, 1994.

          1.2  Purpose.  McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's" or the
     "Company") has established the Plan for its officers, regional
     managers, and certain expatriate international country heads to retain
     and attract highly qualified personnel by offering the benefits of a
     non-qualified, unfunded plan of deferred compensation.  The Company
     may also allow other subsidiaries or affiliates to adopt the Plan in
     accordance with Section 7.

          1.3  Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by the
     Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
     "Committee").  The Committee shall have the powers set forth in the
     Plan and the power to interpret its provisions.  Any decisions of the
     Committee shall be final and binding on all persons with regard to the
     Plan.  The Committee may delegate its authority hereunder to an
     officer or officers of the Company.


                                   Section 2
                      Participation and Deferral Elections

          2.1  Eligibility and Participation.   Subject to the conditions
     and limitations of the Plan, all officers and regional managers of the
     Company and international country heads who are on United States
     payroll and who are identified as eligible by the Committee shall be
     eligible to participate in the Plan ("Eligible Employees").  Any
     Eligible Employee who makes a Deferral Election as described in
     Section 2.2 below shall become a participant in the Plan
     ("Participant") and shall remain a Participant until the entire
     balance of the Participant's Deferral Accounts (defined in Section 4.1
     below) is distributed.

          2.2  Deferral Elections.  Any Eligible Employee may make a
     Deferral Election to defer receipt of all or any portion of his or her
     incentive under the McDonald's Target Incentive Plan ("TIP") for a
     calendar year.  Any Eligible Employee who is one of the five highest
     compensated officers of the Company (ranked by the total of base pay
     and the target incentive under TIP for the current year) may also
     elect to defer up to 50% of his or her base salary for the following
     calendar year.

          2.3  Rules for Deferral Elections.  Deferral Elections shall be
     made in accordance with the rules set forth below:

          (a)  All Deferral Elections must be in writing on such forms as
               the Committee may prescribe and must be returned to the<PAGE>
               Committee no later than the date specified by the Committee.
               In no event will the return date specified by the Committee
               be later than the end of the year that precedes the year
               that the amount being deferred is made available to such
               Eligible Employee.

          (b)  An individual shall be eligible to make a Deferral Election
               only if he or she is an Eligible Employee on the date
               specified by the Committee for the return of Deferral
               Election forms.

          (c)  If an Eligible Employee terminates employment in the same
               calendar year in which he or she makes a Deferral Election,
               that Deferral Election will be null and void and no deferral
               will be made.

          (d)  Amounts will be deferred to the "Payment Date" specified by
               the Eligible Employee in the Deferral Election and payments
               will commence within 30 days following the Payment Date in
               accordance with Section 5.1.  The Payment Date specified
               must be no earlier than the calendar year following the year
               in which the deferred amounts would otherwise have been paid
               and must be either:

               (i)  March 31 or September 30 of a specified year in the
                    future (the "Specific Year Payment Date") or

               (ii) the March 31 following the year in which the
                    Participant terminates employment (the "Employment
                    Termination Payment Date").

               If a Participant terminates employment and has one or more
               Specific Year Payment Dates that would occur after the
               Employment Termination Payment Date, all amounts deferred to
               those Specific Year Payment Date(s) shall automatically be
               accelerated to the Employment Termination Payment Date.
               Participant McDESOP Equalization Amounts and Company Profit
               Sharing Equalization Credits described in Section 3 shall be
               deferred to the Participant's Employment Termination Payment
               Date, even though a Participant has elected a Specific Year
               Payment Date for the remainder of his or her deferral.

               Deferral elections made in 1993 specified either a January
               31 or July 31 payment date.  Due to a change in accounting
               procedures, these payment dates will be converted to March
               31 and September 30, respectively.

          (e)  Each Deferral Election shall specify how amounts deferred
               pursuant to that election are to be invested under Section
               4.2.


                                   Section 3
         Equalization for McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program

          3.1  Equalization to Adjust for Participant 401(k) McDESOP
     Contributions.  Amounts deferred under this Plan are not considered
     compensation for the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program
     (the "Profit Sharing Program") or for the related non-qualified plans:
     the McDonald's 1989 Executive Compensation Plan, the McDonald's<PAGE>
     Supplemental Employee Benefit Equalization Plan and the McDonald's
     Profit Sharing Program Equalization Plan (the "McCAP/McEqual Plans").
     The McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program allows participants
     to contribute a percentage of their compensation as Section 401(k)
     contributions.  Therefore, Eligible Employees who are Profit Sharing
     Program participants and make Deferral Elections under this Plan shall
     automatically have a portion of the amount deferred set aside until
     the Participant's Termination Payment Date to adjust for the fact
     McDESOP Section 401(k) contributions cannot be made to the Profit
     Sharing Program or the related non-qualified plans for deferred
     amounts (the "Participant McDESOP Equalization Amount").  The
     Participant McDESOP Equalization Amount shall be based on the amount
     that would have been contributed by the Participant under the McDESOP
     portion of the Profit Sharing Program and the related non-qualified
     plans if the deferral had not occurred.

          3.2  Company Profit Sharing Equalization Credits.  Amounts
     deferred under this Plan are not considered as compensation under the
     Profit Sharing Program or the McCAP/McEqual Plans.  Therefore, amounts
     deferred under this Plan shall be credited with an amount equal to the
     Company contribution that the Participant would have received under
     the Profit Sharing Program and/or McCAP/McEqual Plans if such deferral
     had not occurred ("Company Profit Sharing Equalization Credit").  If a
     Participant is not eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing
     Program or McCAP/McEqual Plans, or is not eligible to receive a
     Company contribution under such plans with respect to a deferred
     amount, no Company Profit Sharing Equalization Credit will be made.

          3.3  Rules for Profit Sharing Equalization Amounts.
     Equalizations amounts under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above (collectively
     referred to as "Equalization Amounts") shall be deferred until the
     Participant's Employment Termination Payment Date and cannot be
     withdrawn under Section 5.3.  Equalization Amounts will become part of
     the Participant's Deferral Account for the year to which they relate
     and will be credited with earnings as part of that Deferral Account as
     described in Section 4.1.


                                   Section 4
                               Deferral Accounts

          4.1  Deferral Accounts.  A bookkeeping account shall be
     established in the Participant's name for each year for which a
     Participant files a Deferral Election.("Deferral Account").  Each
     year's deferral account may be further divided into:

          (a)  amounts deferred pursuant to that year's Deferral Election
               and earnings thereon,

          (b)  Company Profit Sharing Equalization Credits associated with
               that year's Deferral Election and earnings thereon; and

          (c)  Participant 401(k) McDESOP Equalization amounts associated
               with that year's Deferral Election and earnings thereon.

     The Equalization Amounts described in Section 4.1(b) and (c) above
     shall not be eligible for early withdrawal under Section 5.3.  The
     Committee may also authorize other divisions or subaccounts of the
     deferral accounts as may be necessary to reflect the terms of the plan
     as amended from time to time.<PAGE>

     Amounts deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election shall be credited to
     the Deferral Account as of the end of the month in which, in the
     absence of a Deferral Election, the Participant would otherwise have
     received the deferred amounts.  Any Equalization Amounts shall be
     credited to the Deferral Account as of the end of the month in which
     the amount would have been allocated under the Profit Sharing Program
     or the McCAP/McEqual Plans if the deferral had not occurred.

          4.2  Investment Elections and Earnings Credits.

          (a)  When a Participant makes a Deferral Election, he or she
               shall also elect whether amounts credited to his or her
               Deferral Account for that year shall be credited with one of
               the following rates of return:

               (i)  a rate of return based upon the McDonald's Common Stock
                    Fund under the Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment
                    for expenses ("McDonald's Common Stock" equivalent);

               (ii) a rate of return based upon the Insurance Contract Fund
                    under the Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for
                    expenses ("Insurance Contract" equivalent);

               (iii)a rate of return based upon the Diversified Stock Fund
                    under the Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for
                    expenses ("Diversified Stock" equivalent); or

               (iv) a rate of return based upon the Multi-Asset Fund under
                    the Profit Sharing Program, after adjustment for
                    expenses ("Multi-Asset" equivalent).

               If a Participant fails to make an investment election with
               respect to a Deferral Election, the amount deferred by that
               election shall be credited with the Insurance Contract based
               return.   The rates of return described above shall be
               effective as of January 1, 1995.

               Effective January 1, 1995, participants shall be permitted
               to elect to change the rate of return credited to each
               year's Deferral Account on a prospective basis as of any
               January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 by filing an
               advance written request with the Committee at such time as
               the Committee may specify.

          (b)  As of each March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31
               ("Valuation Date"), each Deferral Account shall be credited
               with earnings, gains and losses equal to the amount the
               Deferral Account would have earned, gained or lost,
               compounded on a monthly basis, since the prior Valuation
               Date.  The Committee, in its discretion, may also request a
               special Valutation Date as of the end of any month.

          4.3  Vesting.  A Participant shall be fully vested at all times
     in the balance of his or her Deferral Account.


                                   Section 5
                              Payment of Benefits<PAGE>

          5.1  Time and Method of Payment.  Payments to a Participant, or
     the Participant's beneficiary if the Participant is deceased, shall
     automatically be paid in a lump sum within 30 days following the
     Payment Date, unless the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary
     files a written installment distribution election on or before
     December 31 of the calendar year preceding the Payment Date.  An
     installment distribution election shall apply to all payments for that
     Payment Date and shall specify the period of years (up to a maximum of
     15 years) over which payments are to be made.  Installment payments
     shall be made in substantially equal installments over the installment
     period specified and shall commence within 30 days after the Payment
     Date.  Each installment payment shall be computed by dividing the
     balance of the Deferral Account(s) that is to be paid in installments
     by the number of years remaining in the installment period.  Once an
     installment election is filed for a payment date, it cannot be
     revoked.  However, because the method of payment described above is
     more flexible, Deferral Elections made in 1993 which specified a five
     year installment payment shall be null and void, and shall be paid in
     a lump sum, unless the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary
     files a written installment election prior to December 31 of the
     calendar year preceding the Payment Date.

          5.2  Form of Payment.  All payments shall be made in cash.
     However, a Participant  who has elected a McDonald's Common Stock
     based return may elect to receive payment in the form of shares of
     McDonald's Common Stock by filing a written request with the Committee
     prior to December 31 of the calendar year preceding the Payment Date.

          5.3  Early Withdrawals and Acceleration of Installment Payments.
     A Participant shall have the right to withdraw in cash any portion of
     the balance of his or her Deferral Accounts (except for the
     Equalization Amounts of the Participant's Deferral Accounts under
     Sections 4.1(b) and (c) and amounts which were not withdrawable under
     the terms of the Plan prior to September 1, 1994) at any time prior to
     the applicable Payment Date, subject to the Committee's consent and a
     10% forfeiture penalty on the amount requested.  A Participant who is
     receiving installment payments may accelerate payment of any unpaid
     amount, subject to the Committee's consent and 10% forfeiture penalty
     on the amount accelerated.  The withdrawal or accelerated installment
     (reduced by the 10% forfeiture penalty) shall be paid within 30 days
     of the March 31 or September 30 next following the date the election
     to withdraw or accelerate payments is approved by the Committee.
     Withdrawals and accelerated installments shall be made first from the
     earliest maturing Deferral Account and shall be taken pro rata from
     the investments in each year's Deferral Account based on the account
     balance of each investment to the total account balance for the
     applicable Payment Date.  Withdrawals shall be subject to such
     procedures as the Committee shall establish from time to time.

          5.4  Withholding of Taxes.  The Company shall withhold any
     applicable Federal, state or local income tax from payments due under
     the Plan.  Any Social Security taxes, including the Medicare portion
     of such taxes, shall be withheld and paid at the time incentive under
     the Target Incentive Plan or base salary would otherwise have been
     paid to the Participant.  The Company shall also withhold any other
     employment taxes as necessary to comply with applicable laws.

          5.5  Limitations For Section 16 Insiders.  A  "Section 16
     Insider" shall include any Participant who has been deemed to be
     subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the<PAGE>
     "Exchange Act") by the Board of Directors of the Company.
     Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the
     Deferral Account of each Section 16 Insider is subject to the
     following limitations:

          (a)  An Eligible Employee who is a Section 16 Insider at the time
               he or she makes a Deferral Election may elect a McDonald's
               Common Stock based return and at the same time must also
               specify whether the payment will be in a lump sum or the
               specific installment period that will apply.  The election
               of a McDonald's Common Stock based return is irrevocable and
               cannot be changed at the quarterly investment change dates
               nor at any other time.  A Participant who is a Section 16
               Insider may not make a withdrawal or accelerate installments
               under Section 5.3 of any Deferral Account(s) that are
               credited with a McDonald's Common Stock based return.
               Insiders who elected a McDonald's Common Stock based return
               and a five year installment in 1993 will not be able to
               change that election.

          (b)  All amounts distributed to a Section 16 Insider shall be
               paid only in cash.  However, to the extent that a former
               Section 16 Insider uses the distribution to purchase shares
               of McDonald's Common Stock on the open market in one or more
               transactions within seven months after the date such amounts
               are distributed, the Company shall reimburse the former
               Section 16 Insider for all reasonable brokerage fees and
               other transaction costs incurred in connection with such
               purchases upon presentation of satisfactory evidence thereof
               not later than 60 days after the date of each transaction.

          (c)  If any Participant becomes a Section 16 Insider after making
               a Deferral Election under the Plan, any Deferral Account
               that is being credited with a McDonald's Common Stock based
               return shall automatically be converted to any non-
               McDonald's Common Stock based investment return specified by
               the Participant as of the Valuation Date immediately
               preceding the date the Participant is designated a Section
               16 Insider by the Board of Directors.  This automatic change
               to non-McDonald's Common Stock based returns will be made to
               preserve the Participant's right to early withdrawals and
               accelerated installments under Section 5.3 for such amounts.

     In addition, the Committee may take such other actions as are
     necessary so that transactions by Section 16 Insiders do not result in
     liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

          5.6  Beneficiary.  A Participant shall have the right to name a
     beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall receive the balance of a
     Participant's Deferral Account in the event of the Participant's death
     prior to the payment of his or her entire Deferral Account.  If no
     beneficiary is named by a Participant or if he or she survives all of
     the named beneficiaries, the Deferral Account shall be paid to the
     same beneficiary or beneficiaries to which the Deferral Account would
     have been paid if it were in the Participant's Profit Sharing Fund
     Account under the Profit Sharing Program as of the date of the
     Participant's death.  To be effective, any beneficiary designation
     shall be filed in writing with the Committee.  A Participant may
     revoke an existing beneficiary designation by filing another written<PAGE>
     beneficiary designation with the Committee.  The latest beneficiary
     designation received by the Committee shall be controlling.


                                   Section 6
                                 Miscellaneous

          6.1  Funding.  Benefits payable under the Plan to any Participant
     shall be paid directly by the Company.  The Company shall not be
     required to fund, or otherwise segregate assets to be used for payment
     of benefits under the Plan.  While the Company may, in the discretion
     of the Committee, make investments (a) in shares of McDonald's Common
     Stock through open market purchases or (b) in other investments in
     amounts equal or unequal to amounts payable hereunder, the Company
     shall not be under any obligation to make such investments and any
     such investment shall remain an asset of the Company subject to the
     claims of its general creditors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
     Company may maintain one or more trusts ("Trust") to hold assets to be
     used for payment of benefits under the Plan.  Any payments by a Trust
     of benefits provided to a Participant under the Plan shall be
     considered payment by the Company and shall discharge the Company of
     any further liability under the Plan for such payments.

          6.2  Account  Statements.  The Company shall provide Participants
     with annual statements of the balance of their Deferral Accounts
     hereunder as of the latest applicable Valuation Date.

          6.3  Employment Rights.  Establishment of the Plan shall not be
     construed to give any Eligible Employee the right to be retained in
     the Company's service or to any benefits not specifically provided by
     the Plan.

          6.4  Interests Not Transferable.  Except as to withholding of any
     tax under the laws of the United States or any state or locality and
     the provisions of Section 5.6, no benefit payable at any time under
     the Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer,
     assignment, pledge, attachment, or other legal process, or encumbrance
     of any kind.  Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge
     or otherwise encumber any such benefits, whether currently or
     thereafter payable, shall be void.  No person shall, in any manner, be
     liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of any person
     entitled to such benefits.  If any person shall attempt to, or shall
     alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber
     benefits under the Plan, or if by any reason of the Participant's
     bankruptcy or other event happening at any time, such benefits would
     devolve upon any other person or would not be enjoyed by the person
     entitled thereto under the Plan, then the Company, in its discretion,
     may terminate the interest in any such benefits of the person entitled
     thereto under the Plan and hold or apply them to or for the benefit of
     such person entitled thereto under the Plan or such individual's
     spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner
     as the Company may deem proper.

          6.5  Forfeitures and Unclaimed Amounts.  Unclaimed amounts shall
     consist of the amounts of the Deferral Accounts of a Participant that
     cannot be distributed because of the Committee's inability, after a
     reasonable search, to locate a Participant or the Participant's
     beneficiary, as applicable, within a period of two (2) years after the
     Payment Date upon which the payment of benefits become due. Unclaimed
     amounts shall be forfeited at the end of such two-year period.<PAGE>
     Penalties charged for withdrawals under Section 5.3 shall also be
     forfeited in the year in which the penalty is charged.  These
     forfeitures will reduce the obligations of the Company under the Plan.
     After an unclaimed amount has been forfeited, the Participant or
     beneficiary, as applicable, shall have no further right to the
     Participant's Deferral Account.

          6.6  Controlling Law.  The law of Illinois, except its law with
     respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all matters relating
     to the Plan to the extent not preempted by ERISA.

          6.7  Action by the Company.  Except as otherwise specifically
     provided herein, any action required of or permitted by the Company
     under the Plan shall be by resolution of the Board of Directors of the
     Company or by action of any member of the Committee or person(s)
     authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company.


                                   Section 7
                             Employer Participation

          7.1  Adoption of Plan.  Any subsidiary or affiliate of the
     Company ("Employer") may, with the approval of the Committee and under
     such terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe, adopt the
     corresponding portions of the Plan by resolution of its board of
     directors.  The Committee may amend the Plan as necessary or desirable
     to reflect the adoption of the Plan by an Employer, provided however,
     that an adopting Employer shall not have the authority to amend or
     terminate the Plan under Section 8.

          7.2  Withdrawal from the Plan by Employer.  Any such Employer
     shall have the right, at any time, upon the approval of and under such
     conditions as may be provided by the Committee, to withdraw from the
     Plan by delivering to the Committee written notice of its election so
     to withdraw.  Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the
     portion of the Deferral Accounts of Participants and beneficiaries
     attributable to credits made while the Participants were employees of
     such withdrawing Employer, plus any net earnings, gains and losses or
     such credits, shall be distributed from the Trust at the direction of
     the Committee in cash at such time or times as the Committee, in its
     sole discretion, may deem to be in the best interest of such employees
     and their beneficiaries. To the extent the amounts held in the Trust
     for the benefit of such Participants and beneficiaries are not
     sufficient to satisfy the Employer's obligation to such Participants
     and their beneficiaries accrued on account of their employment with
     the Employer, the remaining amount necessary to satisfy such
     obligation shall be an obligation of the Employer, and the Company
     shall have no further obligation to such Participants and
     beneficiaries with respect to such amounts.


                                   Section 8
                           Amendment and Termination

          The Company intends the Plan to be permanent, but reserves the
     right at any time by action of its Board of Directors or by the
     Committee (in accordance with the restrictions in the following
     sentence) to modify, amend or terminate the Plan, provided however,
     that any amendment or termination of the Plan shall not reduce or<PAGE>
     eliminate any Deferral Account accrued through the date of such
     amendment or termination.

          The Committee shall have the same authority to adopt amendments
     to the Plan as the Board of Directors of the Company in the following
     circumstances:

          (a)  to adopt amendments to the Plan which the Committee
               determines are necessary or desirable for the Plan to comply
               with or to obtain benefits or advantages under the
               provisions of applicable law, regulations or rulings or
               requirements of the Internal Revenue Service or other
               governmental or administrative agency or changes in such
               law, regulations, rulings or requirements; and

          (b)       to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic amendment
               that the Committee determines to be necessary or desirable
               that does not materially change benefits to Participants or
               their beneficiaries or materially increase the Company's or
               adopting Employers' credits to the Plan.

          The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by the
     Committee to the Board of Directors of the Company on a timely basis.
