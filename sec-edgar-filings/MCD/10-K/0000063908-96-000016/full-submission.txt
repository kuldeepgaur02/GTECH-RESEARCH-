                                     PART I

     Item 1.   Business

          McDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its
     subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company".

          (a)  General development of business

           There have been no significant changes to the Company's
     corporate structure during 1995, nor material changes in the Company's
     method of conducting business.

          (b)  Financial information about industry segments

           Industry segment data for the years ended December 31, 1995,
     1994 and 1993 is included in Part II, item 8, page 44 of this
     Form 10-K.

          (c)  Narrative description of business

          General

           The Company develops, operates, franchises and services a
     worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, assemble, package and
     sell a limited menu of value-priced foods. These restaurants are
     operated by the Company or, under the terms of franchise arrangements,
     by franchisees who are independent third parties, or by affiliates
     operating under joint-venture agreements between the Company and local
     businesspeople.

           The Company's franchising program is designed to assure
     consistency and quality.  The Company is selective in granting
     franchises and is not in the practice of franchising to investor
     groups or passive investors.  Under the conventional franchise
     arrangement, franchisees supply capital - initially, by purchasing
     equipment, signs, seating, and decor, and over the long term, by
     reinvesting in the business.  The Company shares the investment by
     owning or leasing the land and building; franchisees then contribute
     to the Company's revenues through payment of rent and service fees
     based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum payments.
     Generally, the conventional franchise arrangement lasts 20 years and
     franchising practices are consistent throughout the world.  Further
     discussion regarding site selection is included in Part 1, item 2,
     page 6 of this Form 10-K.

           Training begins at the restaurant with one-on-one instruction
     and videotapes.  Aspiring restaurant managers progress through a
     development program of classes in basic and intermediate operations,
     management and equipment.  Assistant managers are eligible to attend
     the advanced operations and management class at one of the five
     Hamburger University (H.U.) campuses in the U.S., Germany, England,
     Japan or Australia.  The curriculum at H.U. concentrates on skills and
     practices essential to delivering customer satisfaction and running a
     restaurant business.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 4
           The Company's global brand is well-known.  Marketing and
     promotional activities are designed to nurture this brand image and
     differentiate the Company from competitors by focusing on value, taste
     and customer satisfaction.  Funding for promotions is handled at the
     local restaurant level; funding for regional and national efforts is
     handled through advertising cooperatives.  Franchised, Company-
     operated and affiliated restaurants throughout the world make
     voluntary contributions to cooperatives which purchase media.
     Production costs for certain advertising efforts are borne by the
     Company.

          Products

           McDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu
     consisting of hamburgers and cheeseburgers, including the Big Mac and
     Quarter Pounder with Cheese sandwiches, the Filet-O-Fish, McGrilled
     Chicken and McChicken sandwiches, french fries, Chicken McNuggets,
     salads, shakes, sundaes and cones made with low fat frozen yogurt,
     pies, cookies and a limited number of soft drinks and other beverages.
     In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of products during limited
     promotional time periods. McDonald's restaurants operating in the
     United States are open during breakfast hours and offer a full
     breakfast menu including the Egg McMuffin and the Sausage McMuffin
     with Egg sandwiches, hotcakes and sausage; three varieties of biscuit
     sandwiches; Apple-Bran muffins; and cereals. McDonald's restaurants in
     many countries around the world offer many of these same products as
     well as other products and limited breakfast menus. The Company tests
     new products on an ongoing basis.

           The Company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food
     products and packaging from numerous independent suppliers.  Quality
     specifications for both raw and cooked food products are established
     and strictly enforced.  Alternative sources of these items are
     generally available.  Quality assurance labs in the U.S., Europe and
     the Pacific work to ensure that the Company's high standards are
     consistently met.  The quality assurance process involves ongoing
     testing and on-site inspections of suppliers' facilities.
     Independently owned and operated distribution centers distribute
     products and supplies to most McDonald's restaurants.  The restaurants
     then prepare, assemble and package these products using specially
     designed production techniques and equipment to obtain uniform
     standards of quality.

          Trademarks and patents

           The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, some
     of which, including "McDonald's", "Ronald McDonald" and other related
     marks, are of material importance to the Company's business. The
     Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while
     valuable, are not material to its business.

          Seasonal operations

           The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to
     any material degree.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 5
          Working capital practices

           Information about the Company's working capital practices is
     incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and
     Analysis of the Company's financial position and the consolidated
     statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994
     and 1993 in Part II, item 7, pages 27 through 30, and Part II, item 8,
     page 36 of this Form 10-K.

          Customers

           The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer
     or small group of customers.

          Backlog

           Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.

          Government contracts

           No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation
     of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election
     of the U.S. government.

          Competition

           McDonald's restaurants compete with international, national,
     regional, and local retailers of food products.  The Company competes
     on the basis of price and service and by offering quality food
     products.  The Company's competition in the broadest perspective
     includes restaurants, quick-service eating establishments, pizza
     parlors, coffee shops, street vendors, convenience food stores,
     delicatessens, and supermarket freezers.

           In the U.S., about 395,000 restaurants generate nearly $240
     billion in annual sales.  McDonald's accounts for about 2.9% of those
     restaurants and approximately 6.6% of those sales.  No reasonable
     estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside of the U.S.;
     however, the Company's business in foreign markets continues to grow.

          Research and development

           The Company operates research and development facilities in
     Illinois. While research and development activities are important to
     the Company's business, these expenditures are not material.
     Independent suppliers also conduct research activities for the benefit
     of the McDonald's System, which includes franchisees and suppliers, as
     well as McDonald's, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 6
          Environmental matters

           The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local
     environmental laws or regulations which will materially affect its
     earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital
     expenditures; however, the Company cannot predict the effect on its
     operations of possible future environmental legislation or
     regulations. During 1995, there were no material capital expenditures
     for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures
     are anticipated.

          Number of employees

           During 1995, the Company's average number of employees
     worldwide, including company-operated restaurant employees, was
     approximately 212,000.

          (d)  Financial information about foreign and domestic operations

           Financial information about foreign and domestic markets is
     incorporated herein by reference from Selected Financial Data,
     Management's Discussion and Analysis and Segment and Geographic
     Information in Part II, item 6, page 10, Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 30 and Part II, item 8, page 44, respectively, of this Form
     10-K.

     Item 2.   Properties

           The Company identifies and develops sites that offer
     convenience to customers and provide for long-term sales and profit
     potential.  To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and
     walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant
     data.  The Company's experience and access to advanced technology aids
     in evaluating this information.  In order to control occupancy costs
     and rights, the Company owns restaurant sites and buildings where
     feasible and where it is not practical, secures long-term leases.
     Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is
     important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to lower average
     development costs through construction and design efficiencies,
     standardization and by leveraging the Company's global sourcing
     system.  Additional information about the Company's properties is
     included in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the related
     financial statements with footnotes in Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 30 and Part II, item 8, pages 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 43, 50 and
     51, respectively, of this Form 10-K.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

           The Company has pending a number of lawsuits which have been
     filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover
     a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's entire business.
     The following is a brief description of the more significant of these
     categories of lawsuits and government regulations.  The Company does
     not believe that any such claims or lawsuits will have a material
     adverse affect on its financial condition or results of operations.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 7
          Franchising

           A substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised
     to independent businesspeople operating under arrangements with the
     Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional
     disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a
     broad range of subjects including, without limitation, quality,
     service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or
     terminations of franchises, franchisee claims for additional
     franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments.

          Suppliers

           The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply,
     with minor exceptions outside of the United States, food, paper, or
     related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon
     independent suppliers which are required to meet and maintain the
     Company's standards and specifications. There are a number of such
     suppliers worldwide and on occasion disputes arise between the Company
     and its suppliers on a number of issues including, by way of example,
     compliance with product specifications and McDonald's business
     relationship with suppliers.

          Employees

           Thousands of persons are employed by the Company and in
     restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In
     addition, thousands of persons, from time to time, seek employment in
     such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise
     regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.

          Customers

           McDonald's restaurants serve a large cross-section of the
     public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as
     to products, service, accidents and other matters typical of an
     extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.

          Trademarks

           McDonald's has registered trademarks and service marks, some of
     which are of material importance to the Company's business.  From time
     to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to defend and
     protect its use of such registered marks.

          Government Regulations

           Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and
     regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business,
     including, but not limited to, franchising, health, environment,
     zoning and employment. The Company does not believe that it is in
     violation of any existing statutory or administrative rules, but it
     cannot predict the effect on its operations from promulgation of
     additional requirements in the future.<PAGE>

               Shareholder Matters

           The Company's common stock trades under the symbol MCD and is
     listed on the following stock exchanges in the United States:  New
     York and Chicago.

           The following table sets forth the common stock price range on
     the New York Stock Exchange composite tape and dividends declared per
     common share.  Prices and dividends have been adjusted to reflect the
     two-for-one common stock split effected in the form of a stock
     dividend in June, 1994.

           The approximate number of shareholders of record and beneficial
     owners of the Company's common stock as of January 31, 1996 was
     estimated to be 798,500.

           Given the Company's returns on equity and assets, the Company's
     management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of
     earnings back into the business.  The Company has paid 80 consecutive
     quarterly dividends on common stock through March 29, 1996, has
     increased the per share amount 21 times since the first dividend was
     paid in 1976, and has increased the dividend amount every year.
     Additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing
     returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing
     needs.<PAGE>

     SYSTEMWIDE SALES AND RESTAURANTS
     Systemwide sales are comprised of sales by restaurants operated by the
     Company, franchisees and affiliates operating under joint-venture
     agreements between McDonald's and local businesspeople. The 1995 and
     1994 sales increases were primarily due to expansion. Stronger foreign
     currencies and higher sales at existing restaurants also contributed
     to these increases. Sales by Company-operated restaurants grew at a
     higher rate than Systemwide sales in 1995 and 1994. For both years,
     the number of Company-operated restaurants grew at a higher rate than
     Systemwide restaurants, and for 1995, Company-operated comparable
     sales were also stronger than Systemwide comparable sales.
       Average sales by Systemwide restaurants open at least one year were
     $1,844,000 in 1995, $44,000 higher than in 1994. Average sales
     improved due to stronger foreign currencies and higher sales at
     existing restaurants, partially offset by lower average sales for
     newer, smaller restaurants. The Company expects that average sales
     will continue to be affected by an increasing proportion of lower-
     volume sites. Profitable expansion into these sites, consistent with
     our Convenience Strategy to gain market share, has been made possible
     by a low-cost approach to restaurant development.
       Expansion continued at an accelerated pace as 2,430 restaurants
     were added Systemwide in 1995 (1,604 traditional and 826 satellites),
     compared with 1,787 in 1994 (1,212 traditional and 575 satellites) and
     1,070 in 1993 (900 traditional and 170 satellites). Generally,
     satellite restaurants offer a simplified menu and are smaller in size
     and sales volume compared to traditional restaurants. McDonald's plans
     to add between 2,500 and 3,200 restaurants around the world annually
     in 1996 and 1997. Between 1,800 and 2,200 of the additions will be
     traditional restaurants, with approximately two thirds outside of the
     U.S. The remainder will be satellite restaurants, about half of which
     will be in the U.S. This higher level of openings is attributable to
     our low-cost approach to restaurant development as well as the
     potential of our alliances with major oil companies and retailers.
     Based on our experience with oil alliance sites, we have determined
     that the majority of future expansion for these venues will be
     traditional restaurants rather than satellite restaurants as
     originally planned.
       The consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results
     of satellite restaurants on the same basis as traditional restaurants.
     The results of satellites operated by the Company are included in
     sales by and costs of Company-operated restaurants, while those
     operated by franchisees are included in revenues from and costs of
     franchised restaurants. Traditional restaurants opened during the year
     contributed $1,002 million to Systemwide sales in 1995, $799 million
     in 1994 and $572 million in 1993. Satellite restaurants opened during
     the year contributed $190 million to Systemwide sales in 1995 and $92
     million in 1994.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 13
     TOTAL REVENUES
     Total revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and
     fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates based on
     a percent of sales with specified minimum payments. The minimum fee
     includes both a rent and service fee amount at a combined rate of
     approximately 12.5% of sales for new U.S. franchise arrangements.
     Prior to 1994, the minimum fee generally was 12.0% for rent and
     service fees combined. Fees may vary depending on the type of site and
     the investment required on the part of the Company. Fees paid by
     franchisees outside of the U.S. vary according to local business
     conditions. Together with occupancy and operating rights, these fees
     are stipulated in franchise arrangements that generally have 20-year
     terms. Accordingly, these fees provide a stable, predictable revenue
     flow to the Company.
       Revenues grow as restaurants are added and as sales build in
     existing restaurants. Menu price adjustments affect revenues and
     sales; however, different pricing structures, new products, promotions
     and product mix variations among markets make quantifying the impact
     of menu price adjustments for the System as a whole impractical.
       Total revenues for 1995 and 1994 increased due to strong global
     operating results, positive comparable sales and an increase in the
     Company-operated restaurant base through expansion and changes in
     ownership.
       In 1995, 60% of sales by Company-operated restaurants and 40% of
     revenues from franchised restaurants were outside of the U.S.,
     compared with 56% and 37%, respectively, in 1994.

     RESTAURANT MARGINS
     Company-operated restaurant margins were 19.2% of sales in 1995,
     compared with 19.8% in 1994 and 19.2% in 1993. As a percent of 1995
     sales, food and paper as well as occupancy and other operating costs
     increased, while payroll costs remained relatively flat. As a percent
     of 1994 sales, food and paper as well as occupancy and other operating
     costs declined, while payroll costs increased.
       Franchised margin dollars comprised about two thirds of the
     combined operating margins, the same as in the prior year. Franchised
     restaurant margins were 82.4% of applicable 1995 revenues, compared
     with 82.8% in 1994 and 83.1% in 1993. The decreases reflected a higher
     proportion of leased sites, resulting from accelerated expansion and
     satellite development, which have financing costs embedded in rent
     expense; whereas, financing costs for owned sites are reflected in
     interest expense.
       Franchised margins include revenues and expenses associated with
     restaurants operating under business facilities lease arrangements.
     Under these arrangements the Company leases the businesses --
     including equipment -- to franchisees who have options to purchase the
     businesses. While higher fees are charged under these arrangements,
     margins are generally lower because of equipment depreciation. When
     these purchase options are exercised, the resulting gains compensate
     the Company for the lower margins prior to exercise and are included
     in other operating (income) expense--net. At year-end 1995, 491
     restaurants were operating under such arrangements, compared with 484
     and 544 at year-end 1994 and 1993, respectively. The majority of these
     restaurants were operated outside of the U.S.<PAGE>

     GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SELLING EXPENSES
     The 1995 and 1994 increases were primarily due to strategic global
     investment spending to support the Convenience, Value and Execution
     Strategies. The 1995 increase was also affected by stronger foreign
     currencies while the 1994 increase included a one-time, noncash $15
     million charge related to the implementation of a new accounting rule
     regarding the timing of expensing advertising production costs. These
     expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales have remained relatively
     constant and were 4.1% in 1995, 4.2% in 1994 and 4.0% in 1993.
       Corporate general, administrative and selling expenses which were
     not allocated to the geographic segments of the business were $48.2
     million in 1995, $47.6 million in 1994 and $37.7 million in 1993.

     OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE--NET
     This category is comprised of transactions that relate to franchising
     and the foodservice business such as gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and net
     gains or losses from property dispositions. The 1995 income increase
     occurred because of greater income from affiliates, principally Japan,
     partially offset by higher losses on property dispositions. The 1994
     income increase reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses and higher income from affiliates, offset in part by higher
     losses on property dispositions.
       Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from
     exercises of purchase options by franchisees operating under business
     facilities lease arrangements and from sales of Company-operated
     restaurants. As a franchisor, McDonald's purchases and sells
     businesses in transactions with franchisees and affiliates in an
     ongoing effort to achieve the optimal ownership mix in each market.
     These transactions and resulting gains are integral to franchising,
     and as such, are recorded in operating income.
       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is reported after
     interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. partnerships which
     are reported before income taxes. The Company actively participates
     in, but does not control, these businesses.
       Net gains or losses from property dispositions result from
     disposals of excess properties through closings, relocations and other
     transactions.

     OPERATING INCOME
     The 1995 and 1994 increases reflected higher combined operating margin
     dollars and stronger foreign currencies, partially offset by higher
     general, administrative and selling expenses. In addition, 1994
     benefited from higher other operating income.

     INTEREST EXPENSE
     The 1995 increase was due to higher average debt levels and stronger
     foreign currencies, partially offset by lower average interest rates.
     The 1994 decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates,
     partially offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign
     currencies.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 15
     NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)--NET
     This category includes interest income, gains and losses related to
     investments and financings, as well as miscellaneous income and
     expense. The 1995 amount included $60 million of unrealized losses
     associated with the Company's investment in Discovery Zone common
     stock. These losses were primarily responsible for the decline in 1995
     U.S. and Corporate income before provision for income taxes shown on
     page 41. Also contributing to the 1995 consolidated results were
     higher charges associated with minority interests, partially offset by
     higher interest income and lower translation losses. The 1994 decrease
     in nonoperating income reflected higher translation losses,
     principally from Mexico and Brazil, losses on investments and higher
     minority interest charges.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
     The effective income tax rate was 34.2% for 1995, compared with 35.1%
     for 1994 and 35.4% for 1993. The 1995 decrease was primarily due to a
     reduction in U.S. state income taxes and an increased proportion of
     earnings from foreign operations. The Company expects its 1996
     effective income tax rate to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, due to
     lower taxes related to foreign operations.
       Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net
     of valuation allowance, of $308 million in 1995, and $233 million in
     1994. Substantially all tax assets arose in the U.S. and other
     profitable markets, the majority of which is expected to be realized
     in future U.S. income tax returns.

     NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
     Net income and net income per common share increased 17% each in 1995
     and 13% and 16%, respectively, in 1994. The spread between the 1994
     percent increase in net income and net income per common share
     reflected the impact of share repurchase. In 1995, the impact of share
     repurchase was offset by the conversion of 11 million shares of Series
     B and C preferred stock into 8.7 million shares of common stock.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 16

     IMPACT OF CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCIES
     While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald's
     lessens short-term cash exposures principally by purchasing goods and
     services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and
     hedging foreign currency-denominated cash flows. Strengthening foreign
     currencies had a positive impact on 1995 Systemwide sales, revenues,
     operating income and net income. Strengthening foreign currencies had
     a positive impact on 1994 Systemwide sales and operating income;
     however, the currency impact on interest expense and higher
     translation losses in Latin America more than offset this benefit,
     resulting in a reduction in net income. Further discussion of our
     management of changing foreign currencies is on pages 28 and 29 in the
     commentary on financings and total shareholders' equity.

     SALES
     Restaurant expansion was primarily responsible for increasing sales in
     1995. In addition, positive comparable sales were driven by the
     Company's continued emphasis on value and customer satisfaction in the
     form of Extra Value Meals, Happy Meals and the three-tier value
     program in 1995 and 1994. Ongoing programs such as Operation Mac
     Attack -- our advertising campaign -- and Fast, Accurate and
     Friendly -- our initiative to improve customer satisfaction -- and
     promotions such as Monopoly also aided 1995 sales, as did various
     promotions in 1994.

     restaurants added globally in 1995 and 1994, compared with about half
     five years ago. Of the worldwide satellite restaurant additions, about
     two thirds were in the U.S. in 1995 and 1994.

     *Operating income prior to 1995 has been restated to reflect a more
      meaningful allocation of general, administrative and selling
      expenses between the U.S. and international segments and includes an
      additional corporate category which is not allocated.

     U.S. revenues were positively impacted by expansion and positive
     comparable sales in 1995, 1994 and 1993, and reduced by the
     franchising of certain Company-operated restaurant businesses in 1992
     and 1991.
       U.S. Company-operated margins decreased $3 million in 1995, as
     lower Company-operated comparable sales and higher costs more than
     offset the positive impact of the growth in the number of Company-
     operated restaurants. These margins were 17.7% of sales in 1995,
     compared with 19.0% in 1994 and 18.3% in 1993. In 1995, the margin
     decline was driven by higher payroll costs as a percent of sales
     resulting from an increase in the average hourly wage rate and
     increased staffing levels designed to improve customer satisfaction.
     In 1995 and 1994, the margin benefited from cost reduction efforts and
     lower commodity costs.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 19
       U.S. franchised margins rose $109 million or 8% in 1995, driven by
     expansion and positive comparable sales. These margins were 82.6% of
     applicable revenues in 1995, compared with 83.2% in 1994 and 83.6% in
     1993. Franchised margins as a percent of revenues declined in 1995 and
     1994 as the growth in rent expense, resulting from an increase in the
     proportion of new leased sites, particularly satellite locations,
     outpaced the growth in franchised revenues.
       With the current intensely competitive U.S. operating environment,
     we expect continuing pressure on Company-operated margins. However,
     while it is difficult to assess the potential effects of legislation
     and other factors that may affect the industry, the Company believes
     it can maintain annual operating margins as a percent of sales within
     the historical range of the past ten years by continuing to build
     sales and reduce costs.
       U.S. operating income rose $35 million or 3% in 1995 and $61
     million or 5% in 1994, and was 48% and 54% of consolidated operating
     income in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The 1995 and 1994 increases
     resulted primarily from higher combined operating margins, partially
     offset by higher general, administrative and selling expenses in the
     form of higher employee costs, and other expenditures to support our
     Convenience, Value and Execution Strategies. 1994 U.S. operating
     income was also impacted by a one-time, $12 million charge related to
     the implementation of a new accounting rule for advertising costs.
     Operating income included depreciation and amortization of $398
     million in 1995, $366 million in 1994 and $348 million in 1993.
       While the U.S. market remains intensely competitive, McDonald's is
     confident of continued growth in operating income over the long term
     through expansion, by controlling costs at the developmental,
     operational and administrative levels, and through a greater emphasis
     on value and customer satisfaction.

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     U.S. assets increased $547 million or 8% in 1995 and $293 million or
     5% in 1994. These increases were due to accelerated expansion and
     increased reinvestment in existing restaurants during 1995. At year-
     end 1995, 46% of consolidated assets were located in the U.S.,
     compared with 48% at year-end 1994.

       U.S. capital expenditures increased $209 million or 30% in 1995,
     and represented 44% of consolidated capital expenditures, compared
     with 47% five years ago. These amounts excluded initial investments
     made by franchisees in equipment, signs, seating and decor, as well as
     their ongoing reinvestment expenditures. New restaurant expenditures
     increased $130 million or 28%, primarily because of accelerated
     expansion.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants were made to achieve higher
     levels of customer satisfaction and implement technology to improve
     service and food quality. In 1995, strategic reinvestment to build
     sales included $57 million for indoor Ronald's Playplaces and $37
     million for rebuilding and relocating restaurants to adjust to
     changing demographics, traffic patterns and market opportunities. Over
     the past five years, $188 million has been invested to replace older
     buildings with new lower-cost, more efficient restaurants.
       Other properties primarily included expenditures for office
     buildings and related furnishings.

     =========================================================================

       U.S. average development costs increased in 1995 primarily due to
     higher site development and preparation costs combined with
     investments for indoor Ronald's Playplaces in more than 25% of new
     traditional restaurants. Construction efficiencies and a further shift
     toward smaller, lower-cost building designs partially offset these
     increases.
       Average development costs have decreased 26% from 1990 levels.
     Initiatives such as the Company's new joint venture to develop modular
     restaurant buildings serve as an example of our commitment to further
     reduce development costs through standardization, global sourcing and
     greater economies of scale. Our objective is to profitably expand into
     more locations, consistent with McDonald's goal of increasing market
     share with greater marketwide presence throughout the world.
       Because real estate ownership yields long-term benefits, including
     the ability to fix occupancy costs, the Company purchases new
     properties and acquires previously leased properties to the extent
     practical. The Company owned 68% of traditional U.S. sites at year-end
     1995, compared with 69% five years ago. Most satellite restaurants are
     leased locations.<PAGE>

     OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     SALES
     Sales outside of the U.S. rose 27% in 1995 and 18% in 1994 due to
     aggressive expansion, stronger foreign currencies and higher local
     currency sales at existing restaurants in all geographic segments
     except Canada. This strong sales growth in 1995 was achieved despite
     weak economies in several markets. In 1995, 47% of Systemwide sales
     were from markets located outside of the U.S. compared with 43% in
     1994 and 35% five years ago.

     ======================================================================

       In Asia/Pacific, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and
     Taiwan reported strong 1995 sales increases driven by Extra Value Meal
     marketing campaigns and rapid store expansion.
       In Europe, restaurant expansion continued to drive 1995 sales
     growth in Austria, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands and
     Spain.
       In Latin America, due to the mid-1994 economic reforms, Brazil's
     tremendous sales growth continued into 1995. Results in Mexico
     continued to be impacted by the weak economy and further peso
     devaluation. We currently anticipate this trend to continue through at
     least 1996; however, we believe this market offers long-term
     potential.
       Canada's 1995 sales growth was impacted by a slow economy and
     decreased consumer retail spending.
       Average sales by total restaurants outside of the U.S. open at
     least one year were $2,422,000 in 1995 and $2,254,000 in 1994. This
     increase reflected stronger foreign currencies and higher local
     currency sales.

     RESTAURANTS
     During the past five years, 56% of Systemwide and 64% of traditional
     restaurant additions have been outside of the U.S. Of the 1,007
     traditional restaurants added outside of the U.S. in 1995, 42% were in
     the six largest markets -- Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany
     and Japan -- compared with 51% in 1994. Of the 293 satellite
     restaurants added in 1995, 86% were in the six largest markets
     compared with 74% in 1994.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 22
       In 1995, Japan added 313 total restaurants (109 traditional and 204
     satellites), representing 24% of the total restaurants added outside
     of the U.S. Japan's profitable expansion was supported by significant
     reductions in average restaurant development costs achieved through
     standardization of building designs and utilization of smaller
     buildings.
       In 1996 and 1997, more than half of total restaurant additions
     outside of the U.S. are anticipated to be in the six largest markets
     while new and emerging markets, such as the Middle East, China and
     Central Europe are expected to represent a growing proportion of
     expansion.

       At year-end 1995, 38% of Systemwide restaurants were outside of the
     U.S. compared with 36% in 1994 and 27% five years ago. Restaurants
     outside of the U.S. comprised 53% of traditional Company-operated
     restaurants and 27% of traditional franchised restaurants. About 29%
     of the traditional restaurants outside of the U.S. were Company-
     operated, 47% were franchised and 24% were operated by affiliates.
     Approximately 69% of traditional Company-operated restaurants were in
     England, Canada, Germany, Australia, Taiwan and Brazil. About 66% of
     traditional franchised restaurants were in Canada, Germany, Australia,
     France, England and the Netherlands. Restaurants operated by
     affiliates were principally located in Japan and other Asia/Pacific
     countries.
       Approximately 81% of satellite restaurants outside of the U.S. were
     operated by franchisees and affiliates at year-end 1995. The vast
     majority were located in Japan, Canada and Brazil.<PAGE>

      between the U.S. and international segments and includes an additional
      corporate category which is not allocated.

       The growth in 1995 and 1994 revenue and operating income was driven
     by higher combined operating margin dollars resulting from expansion,
     positive comparable sales and stronger foreign currencies. The six
     largest markets accounted for about 75% of total operating income
     outside of the U.S. in 1995 and contributed 70% to operating income
     growth outside of the U.S. in 1995 compared with 53% in 1994.<PAGE>

      additional corporate category which is not allocated.

       Company-operated margins increased $172 million or 26% in 1995.
     Company-operated margins accounted for 53% of the total operating
     income increase outside of the U.S. in 1995 and 55% of this increase
     in 1994. The six largest markets contributed about 68% to total
     Company-operated margin dollars outside of the U.S. in 1995 and
     accounted for 46% of the increase over 1994.
       Company-operated margins declined as a percent of sales in 1995 to
     20.2% compared with 20.5% in 1994 and 20.1% in 1993. The 1995 decline
     resulted from a strategic decision to invest incremental margin
     dollars into our Value Strategy, designed to increase market share and
     customer satisfaction, coupled with a comparison to extremely strong
     results in the second half of 1994, primarily due to Brazil. The
     Company believes it can maintain these annual operating margins as a
     percent of sales within the historical range of the past ten years by
     continuing to build sales and reduce costs.
       Franchised margins grew $213 million or 28% in 1995. These margins
     were 82.1% of applicable revenues in 1995 and 1994 compared with 82.0%
     in 1993. Franchised margin dollar growth was driven by expansion and
     positive comparable sales.
       The 1995 and 1994 increases in general, administrative and selling
     expenses were caused principally by additional employee costs
     associated with rapid expansion in new and emerging markets,
     government-mandated payroll and social cost increases and stronger
     foreign currencies.
       Other operating income increased in 1995 primarily due to higher
     income from affiliates, principally Japan. Japan's increased income
     resulted from expansion as well as an aggressive value strategy
     emphasizing Extra Value Meals which resulted in strong comparable
     sales.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 25
       The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment accounted for 61% of revenues
     and 60% of operating income outside of the U.S. in 1995, growing $650
     and $195 million, respectively in 1995 and $369 and $113 million,
     respectively, in 1994. Germany, England and France accounted for 83%
     of this segment's operating income in 1995, compared with 82% in 1994.
     Stronger currencies contributed about one third of this segment's
     operating income increase over 1994. This benefit diminished as the
     U.S. Dollar strengthened later in 1995.
       Asia/Pacific revenues grew $280 and $236 million and operating
     income increased $76 and $53 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan contributed 86% of this
     segment's operating income in 1995. Japan's profits increased
     significantly compared to 1994 due to an aggressive value campaign and
     accelerated expansion. Australia experienced strong sales increases in
     1995 from significant restaurant expansion and higher sales at
     existing restaurants through a continued emphasis on value. The
     Company's share of Taiwan's 1995 and 1994 revenues increased as a
     result of a change in ownership from a joint venture to a wholly-owned
     subsidiary in May 1994. The 1994 increases in revenues and operating
     income were also attributable to expansion and developing economies in
     many markets, with the exception of Japan, which suffered from a weak
     economy. Strong currencies contributed to this segment's 1995
     operating income increase. As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the
     Yen in the later part of the year, the currency benefit significantly
     decreased.
       Latin American revenues grew $223 and $95 million and operating
     income increased $57 and $35 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Brazil continued to be primarily responsible for the Latin American
     operating income increase due to expansion as well as significant
     sales increases from existing restaurants which began in mid-1994 due
     to economic reforms. Brazil's restaurant base grew by 25% in 1995 and
     27% in 1994. Mexico continued to be negatively impacted by the economy
     and currency devaluation.
       Canadian revenues increased $2 million in 1995 and decreased $12
     million in 1994, while operating income decreased $2 million in 1995
     and increased $6 million in 1994. The 1995 results reflect lower sales
     at existing restaurants, caused by the slow economy, partially offset
     by new restaurant growth.<PAGE>

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Assets outside of the U.S. rose $1.3 billion or 19% in 1995 due to
     expansion and stronger foreign currencies. At year-end 1995, about 53%
     of consolidated assets were located outside of the U.S.; 57% of these
     assets were located in England, Germany, France, Australia and Canada.

     =======================================================================

       In the past five years, $4.2 billion has been invested by the
     Company outside of the U.S. Capital expenditures outside of the U.S.
     rose $294 million or 35% in 1995 reflecting growth in all geographic
     segments. Approximately 66% of 1995 capital expenditures outside of
     the U.S. were invested in Europe -- primarily in Germany, France and
     England.
       Overall average development costs for new restaurants for the five
     largest, majority-owned markets -- Australia, Canada, England, France
     and Germany -- were nearly double the U.S. average. These investments
     accommodate higher sales volumes and transaction counts. Since 1990,
     average development costs have decreased due to construction and
     design efficiencies, standardization, global sourcing and changes in
     the mix of openings.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included dining room remodels
     to achieve increased levels of customer satisfaction and technology
     upgrades to improve service and food quality. The majority of these
     expenditures were in Europe. Expenditures for other properties were
     principally for office facilities.
       As in the U.S., the Company emphasizes restaurant property
     ownership outside of the U.S.; however, various laws and regulations
     make property acquisition and ownership much more difficult. Property
     is purchased when legally and economically feasible; otherwise, long-
     term leases are an alternative. In addition, certain markets have laws
     and customs that offer stronger tenancy rights than are available in
     the U.S. The Company owned 34% of traditional sites outside of the
     U.S. at year-end 1995, compared with 36% in 1994 and 35% five years
     ago.
       Capital expenditures made by affiliates -- which were not included
     in consolidated amounts -- were $258 million in 1995, compared with
     $203 million in 1994. The majority of the 1995 expenditures were for
     development in Japan, Sweden, Argentina, Russia and Singapore.<PAGE>

     FINANCIAL POSITION
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     TOTAL ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Total assets grew approximately $1.8 billion or 13% in 1995; net
     property and equipment represented 83% of total assets and rose $1.5
     billion. Capital expenditures increased $503 million or 32%,
     reflecting increased expansion, reinvestment in existing restaurants
     and stronger foreign currencies.

     ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
     In the first quarter of 1996, the Company will adopt Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
     of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. This
     statement requires impairment losses be recognized for long-lived
     assets, whether these assets are held for disposal or continue to be
     used in operations, when indicators of impairment are present and the
     fair value of assets are estimated to be less than carrying amounts.
     After reviewing its assets for impairment, the Company anticipates a
     pre-tax charge to operating income of approximately $16 million
     related to restaurant sites in Mexico on adoption of this new
     accounting standard.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS
     Cash provided by operations increased $370 million or 19% in 1995, and
     $246 million or 15% in 1994. Together with other sources of cash such
     as borrowings, cash provided by operations was used principally for
     capital expenditures, debt repayments, share repurchase and dividends.
     For the fifth consecutive year, cash provided by operations exceeded
     capital expenditures.
       While cash generated is significant relative to cash required, the
     Company also has the ability to meet any short-term needs through
     commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
     Accordingly, a relatively low current ratio has been purposefully
     maintained; it was .53 at year-end 1995.
       The Company believes that cash flow measures are meaningful
     indicators of growth and financial strength, when evaluated in the
     context of absolute dollars, uses and consistency. Cash provided by
     operations is expected to cover capital expenditures over the next
     several years, even as expansion continues to accelerate.

     FINANCINGS
     The Company strives to minimize interest expense and the impact of
     changing foreign currencies while maintaining the capacity to meet
     increasing growth requirements. To accomplish these objectives,
     McDonald's generally finances long-term assets with long-term debt in
     the currencies in which the assets are denominated, while remaining
     flexible to take advantage of changing foreign currencies and interest
     rates.
       Over the years, major capital markets and various techniques have
     been utilized to meet financing requirements and reduce interest
     expense. Currency exchange agreements have been employed in
     conjunction with borrowings to obtain desired currencies at attractive
     rates. Interest-rate exchange agreements have been used to effectively
     convert fixed-rate to floating-rate debt, or vice versa. Foreign
     currency-denominated debt has been used to lessen the impact of
     changing foreign currencies on net income and shareholders' equity by
     designating these borrowings as hedges of intercompany financings or
     the Company's long-term investments in its foreign subsidiaries and
     affiliates. Total foreign currency-denominated debt, including the
     effects of currency exchange agreements, was $4.3 and $4.0 billion at
     year-end 1995 and 1994, respectively.

       The Company manages its debt portfolio to respond to changes in
     interest rates and foreign currencies and accordingly, periodically
     retires, redeems, and repurchases debt; terminates exchange
     agreements; and uses derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives
     with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to
     be hedged and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
     purposes; all exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments.<PAGE>

       While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, the
     Company actively hedges selected foreign currencies, primarily to
     minimize the cash exposure of royalty and other payments received in
     the U.S. in local currencies. McDonald's restaurants also primarily
     purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural
     hedges and McDonald's typically finances in local currencies creating
     economic hedges. The Company's exposure is diversified within a broad
     basket of currencies. At year-end 1995, assets in hyperinflationary
     markets and in Mexico were principally financed in U.S. Dollars. The
     Company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency
     assets less foreign currency liabilities) by foreign currency were as
     follows:

       Moody's and Standard & Poor's have rated McDonald's debt Aa2 and
     AA, respectively, since 1982. Duff & Phelps began rating the debt in
     1990, and currently rates it AA+. At the present time, these strong
     ratings are important to McDonald's in the context of our global
     development plans. The Company has not experienced, nor does it expect
     to experience, difficulty in obtaining financing or in refinancing
     existing debt. At year-end 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries had
     $1.3 billion available under line of credit agreements and $785
     million under previously filed shelf registrations available for
     future debt issuance.
       Although McDonald's prefers to own real estate, leases are an
     alternative financing method. As in the past, some new properties will
     be leased. Such leases frequently include renewal and/or purchase
     options. In the past five years, the Company and its affiliates have
     leased properties related to 40% of U.S. traditional restaurant
     openings and 66% of traditional restaurant openings outside of the
     U.S.
       Since 1990, the Company has improved its balance sheet by reducing
     leverage while simultaneously increasing expansion and repurchasing
     shares.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 30
     TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     Total shareholders' equity rose $976 million or 14% in 1995,
     representing 51% of total assets at year-end. Stronger foreign
     currencies increased shareholders' equity by $28 million in 1995.
       One technique used to enhance common shareholder value is share
     repurchase using excess cash flow or debt capacity, while maintaining
     a strong equity base for future expansion. McDonald's has repurchased
     $2.8 billion of its common stock, representing 148 million shares,
     over the past 10 years. At year-end 1995, the market value of shares
     recorded as common stock in treasury was $6.3 billion, compared to the
     cost of $2.5 billion.
       In January 1996, the Company announced plans to repurchase $2.2
     billion of its common stock within the next three years, including
     $200 million remaining under the three-year, $1 billion program
     announced in January 1994. In 1993, the Company completed a $700
     million common share repurchase program begun in 1992.

     RETURNS
     Return on average assets is computed using operating income. Net
     income less preferred stock dividends (net of tax in 1995, 1994, 1993
     and 1992) is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-
     end balances are used to compute both average assets and average
     common equity.


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    1995    1994     1993     1992     1991
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Return on average assets       17.9%   17.6%    17.0%    16.4%    15.7%
     Return on average common
       equity                       19.9    19.4     19.0     18.2     19.1
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The improvements in return on average assets since 1991 reflected
     better global operating results and a slower rate of asset growth. The
     1995, 1994 and 1993 improvements in return on average common equity
     reflected higher levels of share repurchase, whereas the decline in
     1992 resulted from a lower level of share repurchase as excess cash
     flow was used to reduce debt.

     EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES--INFLATION
     McDonald's has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost
     increases effectively. Rapid inventory turnover, ability to adjust
     prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings -- many of
     which are at fixed costs and partially financed by debt made cheaper
     by inflation -- have enabled McDonald's to mitigate the effects of
     inflation. In hyperinflationary markets, menu board prices typically
     are adjusted to keep pace, thereby mitigating the effect on reported
     results.<PAGE>

     MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair
     presentation of the consolidated financial statements and Financial
     Comments appearing in this annual report. The financial statements
     were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
     principles and include certain amounts based on management's judgment
     and best estimates. Other financial information presented in the
     annual report is consistent with the financial statements.
       The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
     reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized
     acquisition, use or disposition, which is designed to provide
     reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of
     Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial
     statements and such asset safeguarding. The system includes a
     documented organizational structure and appropriate division of
     responsibilities; established policies and procedures which are
     communicated throughout the Company; careful selection, training, and
     development of our people; and utilization of an internal audit
     program. Policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all
     employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and that
     business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a
     manner which is above reproach.
       There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system
     of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the
     circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
     effective internal control system can provide only reasonable
     assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
     safeguarding of assets. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal
     control system can change with circumstances. The Company believes
     that at December 31, 1995, it maintained an effective system of
     internal control over financial reporting and safeguarding of assets
     against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.
       The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
     independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, who were given unrestricted
     access to all financial records and related data. The audit report of
     Ernst & Young LLP is presented below.
       The Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee
     composed entirely of independent Directors, provides oversight to the
     financial reporting process. Ernst & Young LLP has independent access
     to the Audit Committee and periodically meets with the Committee to
     discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Board of Directors and Shareholders
     McDonald's Corporation
     Oak Brook, Illinois

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
     McDonald's Corporation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
     related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
     cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
     31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of
     McDonald's Corporation management. Our responsibility is to express an
     opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
     the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.
       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
     of McDonald's Corporation at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
     consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
     the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity
     with generally accepted accounting principles.

     MCDONALD'S CORPORATION FINANCIAL COMMENTS

     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
     Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates, in which the
     Company owns 50% or less, are carried at equity in the companies' net
     assets.

     ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
     and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
     liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
     and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
     from those estimates.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
     The functional currency of substantially all operations outside of the
     U.S. is the respective local currency, except for hyperinflationary
     countries where it is the U.S. Dollar.

     ADVERTISING COSTS
     Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed as
     of the date the commercials are initially aired. Advertising expenses
     included in costs of Company-operated restaurants and general,
     administrative and selling expenses were (in millions): 1995--$431.0;
     1994--$385.6; 1993--$353.8.

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
     Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which is
     effective in 1996. As permitted by the new standard, the Company will
     continue applying accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 and
     include additional footnote disclosures.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and
     amortization provided on the straight-line method over the following
     estimated useful lives: buildings--up to 40 years; leasehold
     improvements--lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms
     including option periods; and equipment--3 to 12 years.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangible assets, consisting primarily of franchise rights reacquired
     from franchisees and affiliates, are amortized on the straight-line
     method over an average life of 30 years.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 39
     ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
     In the first quarter of 1996, the Company will adopt Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
     of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. This
     statement requires impairment losses be recognized for long-lived
     assets, whether these assets are held for disposal or continue to be
     used in operations, when indicators of impairment are present and the
     fair value of assets are estimated to be less than carrying amounts.
     After reviewing its assets, the Company anticipates a pre-tax charge
     to operating income of approximately $16 million related to restaurant
     sites in Mexico on adoption of this new accounting standard.

     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The Company utilizes derivatives in managing risk, but not for trading
     purposes. Non-U.S. Dollar financing transactions generally are
     effective as hedges of either long-term investments in or intercompany
     loans to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Foreign currency gains
     and losses on the hedges of long-term investments are recorded as
     foreign currency translation adjustment included in shareholders'
     equity. Gains and losses related to hedges of intercompany loans
     offset the gains and losses on intercompany loans and are recorded in
     nonoperating income (expense).
       Interest-rate exchange agreements are designated and effective to
     modify the Company's interest-rate exposures. Net interest is accrued
     as either interest receivable or payable with the offset recorded in
     interest expense. Gains or losses from the early termination of
     interest rate swaps are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense
     over the shorter of the remaining life of the swap or the underlying
     debt being hedged.
       The Company also purchases foreign currency options (with little or
     no intrinsic value) to hedge future foreign currency-denominated
     royalty and other payments received in the U.S. The premiums paid for
     these options are amortized over the option life and are recorded in
     nonoperating expense. Any realized gains on exercised options are
     deferred and amortized over the period being hedged.
       Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to
     mitigate exposure on foreign currency-denominated cash flows received
     from affiliates and subsidiaries. These contracts are marked to market
     with the resulting gains or losses recorded in nonoperating income
     (expense). Gains and losses associated with these forward contracts
     have not been material.
       If a hedged item matures or is extinguished, the associated
     derivative is marked to market with the resulting gain or loss
     recognized immediately. The derivative then is redesignated as a hedge
     of some other item or terminated.
       The carrying amounts for cash and equivalents and notes receivable
     approximated fair value. No fair value was provided for noninterest-
     bearing security deposits by franchisees as these deposits are an
     integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.

     STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
     The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments to be cash
     equivalents. The impact of changing foreign currencies on cash and
     equivalents was not material.<PAGE>

     Proceeds from certain sales of restaurant businesses and property
     include notes receivable. The 1995 increase in equity in earnings of
     unconsolidated affiliates occurred because of greater income from
     affiliates, principally Japan.<PAGE>

     SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company operates exclusively in the foodservice industry.
     Substantially all revenues result from the sale of menu products at
     restaurants operated by the Company, franchisees or affiliates.
     Operating income includes the Company's share of operating results of
     affiliates. All intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in
     computing revenues and operating income. Fees received from
     subsidiaries outside of the U.S. were (in millions): 1995--$358.4;
     1994--$268.9; 1993--$202.8.
       Segment operating income has been restated to reflect a more
     meaningful allocation of general, administrative and selling expenses
     between the U.S. and international segments and includes an additional
     corporate category. In addition, segment assets have been restated to
     reflect an additional corporate category, primarily comprised of
     corporate cash, investments, asset portions of financing instruments
     and certain intangibles.

     DEBT FINANCING
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
     Effective April 19, 1995, the Company canceled its existing $700.0
     million line of credit agreement and entered into a new $675.0 million
     five-year revolving credit agreement with various banks. Accordingly,
     $675.0 million of notes maturing within one year have been
     reclassified as long-term debt. In June 1995, the Company entered into
     an additional $25.0 million revolving credit agreement with various
     banks for a renewable term of 364 days. Both agreements, which
     remained unused at December 31, 1995, provide for fees of .07% per
     annum on the total commitment. Each borrowing under the agreements
     bears interest at one of several specified floating rates selected by
     the Company at the time of borrowing. In addition, certain
     subsidiaries outside of the U.S. had unused lines of credit totaling
     $550.5 million at December 31, 1995; these were principally short-term
     and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of
     interest. The weighted average interest rates of short-term
     borrowings, comprised of commercial paper and foreign-denominated bank
     line borrowings, were 6.4% and 6.8% at December 31, 1995, and 1994,
     respectively.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 46
     EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS
     The Company has entered into agreements for the exchange of various
     currencies, certain of which also provide for the periodic exchange of
     interest payments. These agreements, as well as additional interest-
     rate exchange agreements, expire through 2003. The interest-rate
     exchange agreements had a notional amount with a U.S. Dollar
     equivalent of $1.6 billion at December 31, 1995, and were denominated
     primarily in U.S. Dollars, Japanese Yen, Deutsche Marks and British
     Pounds Sterling. The net value of each exchange agreement was
     classified as an asset or liability based on its carrying amount, and
     any related interest income was netted against interest expense.
       The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group
     of financial institutions. The Company continually monitors its
     positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and adjusts
     positions as appropriate. The Company does not have a significant
     exposure to any individual counterparty, and has entered into master
     agreements that contain netting arrangements.
       The Company purchased foreign currency options which were
     outstanding at December 31, 1995, with a notional amount equivalent to
     U.S. $187.7 million in various currencies, primarily Deutsche Marks,
     British Pounds Sterling and French Francs. At December 31, 1995, the
     unamortized premium related to these currency options was $4.9
     million. There were no deferred gains related to these options at year
     end. Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at
     December 31, 1995, had a U.S. Dollar equivalent of $27.6 million in
     various currencies, primarily Deutsche Marks, Japanese Yen and Swiss
     Francs.

     GUARANTEES
     The Company has guaranteed and included in total debt at December 31,
     1995, $146.7 million of 7.4% ESOP Notes Series A and $77.1 million of
     7.1% ESOP Notes Series B issued by the Leveraged Employee Stock
     Ownership Plan with payments through 2004 and 2006, respectively.
     Interest rates on the notes were adjusted in 1995 due to refinancing
     of certain sinking fund payments. The Company has agreed to repurchase
     the notes upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company also has
     guaranteed certain foreign affiliate loans totaling $60.6 million at
     December 31, 1995.
       The Company was a general partner in 92 domestic partnerships with
     total assets of $407.9 million and total liabilities of $232.5 million
     at December 31, 1995.<PAGE>

     Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts were recorded at their
     fair value of $27.6 million at December 31, 1995. The fair value of
     the debt and notes payable obligations (excluding capital leases), the
     currency and interest-rate exchange agreements, and the foreign
     currency options was estimated using quoted market prices, various
     pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses. The Company has no
     current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to
     maturity. Given the market value of its common stock and its
     significant real estate holdings, the Company believes that the fair
     value of total assets was higher than their carrying value at December
     31, 1995.

     DEBT OBLIGATIONS
     The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public
     and private offerings and bank loans. The terms of most debt
     obligations contain restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages
     and long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements,
     the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at
     par or at a premium over par. The following table summarizes these
     debt obligations, including the gross effects of currency and
     interest-rate exchange agreements.<PAGE>

     LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1995, the Company was lessee at 2,976 locations under
     ground leases (the Company leases land and constructs and owns
     buildings) and at 4,204 locations under improved leases (lessor owns
     land and buildings). Land and building lease terms for most
     traditional restaurants are generally for 20 to 25 years and, in many
     cases, provide for rent escalations and one or more five-year renewal
     options with certain leases providing purchase options. Most satellite
     restaurants operate under improved leases which generally include
     percentage rent payments only and are of a shorter term. For most
     locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs
     which include property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition,
     the Company is lessee under noncancelable leases covering offices and
     vehicles.
       Future minimum payments required under operating leases with
     initial terms of one year or more are:

     FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Franchise arrangements include a lease and a license and generally
     provide for initial fees as well as continuing rent and service fee
     payments to the Company, based upon a percentage of sales with minimum
     rent payments. Franchisees are granted the right to operate a
     McDonald's restaurant using the McDonald's system. Additionally,
     franchisees are provided the use of a restaurant facility generally
     for a period of 20 years. They are required to pay related occupancy
     costs which include property taxes, insurance, maintenance and a
     refundable, noninterest-bearing security deposit. On a limited basis
     the Company accepts notes from franchisees which generally are secured
     by interests in restaurant equipment and franchises.

     PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company has a program for U.S. employees which includes profit
     sharing, 401(k) (McDESOP), and leveraged employee stock ownership
     (LESOP) features. McDESOP allows participants to make contributions
     which are partially matched by the Company. Profit sharing assets and
     contributions made by McDESOP participants can be invested in
     McDonald's common stock or among several other investment
     alternatives. Company contributions to McDESOP are invested in
     McDonald's common stock. Due to the conversion of all remaining
     preferred shares in 1995, the LESOP is now invested only in McDonald's
     common stock.
       Staff, executives and restaurant managers participate in profit
     sharing contributions and shares released under the LESOP based on
     participant's compensation. The profit sharing contribution is
     discretionary, and the amount is determined by the Company each year.
     The LESOP contribution is based on the loan payments necessary to
     amortize the debt initially incurred to acquire the stock. Shares held
     by the LESOP are allocated to participants as the loan is repaid.
     Dividends on shares held by the LESOP are used to service the debt,
     and shares are released to participants to replace the dividends on
     shares that have been allocated to them. LESOP costs shown in the
     following table were based upon the cash paid for loan payments less
     these dividends.

       Certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. also offer profit sharing,
     stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs
     outside of the U.S. were (in millions): 1995  $26.6 1994--$18.1;
     1993--$13.0.
       Profit sharing costs were restated to reflect a more meaningful
     allocation of program costs between the U.S. and outside of the U.S.
     segments. The Company does not provide any other postretirement
     benefits, and postemployment benefits were immaterial.<PAGE>

     STOCK OPTIONS
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1995, the Company had three stock-based compensation
     plans which were accounted for under APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,
     no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated financial
     statements for these plans because options to purchase common stock
     are granted at prices not less than the fair market value of the stock
     on date of grant.
       Substantially all of the options under these plans become
     exercisable in four equal biennial installments, commencing one year
     from date of grant, and expire ten years from date of grant. At
     December 31, 1995, 105.1 and 37.0 million shares of common stock were
     reserved for issuance and for future grants, respectively, under these
     plans.

       Options granted during each year were 1.96%, 1.94% and 1.69% of
     average common shares outstanding for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
     respectively. Stock options were granted to approximately 8,500, 7,700
     and 6,800 employees in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Shares are
     issued from treasury stock to employees upon exercise of stock
     options.
       The potential dilution of common shares outstanding upon exercise
     of stock options shown in the following table represents the number of
     common shares issuable upon exercise less the number of common shares
     that could be repurchased with proceeds from the exercise, based upon
     the respective December 31 prices of the Company's common stock. As
     such, this potential dilution was 2.9%, 1.6% and 1.8% of shares
     outstanding at year-end 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.<PAGE>

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

          As shown above, the average option exercise price has
     consistently exceeded the average cost of treasury stock issued for
     option exercises because of the Company's practice of prefunding the
     program through share repurchase. As a result, stock option exercises
     have generated additional capital, as cash received from employees has
     exceeded the Company's average acquisition cost of treasury stock.

     CAPITAL STOCK
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION
     Income used in the computation of per common share information was
     reduced by preferred stock cash dividends (net of tax benefits). In
     1995, it was also reduced by $3.9 million for the one-time effect of
     the Company's offer to exchange its Series E 7.72% Cumulative
     Preferred Stock for subordinated debt securities completed on June 30,
     1995, and by an additional $.4 million for the effect of the Company's
     repurchase of additional Series E preferred stock in the third
     quarter. Adjusted net income was divided by the weighted average
     shares of common stock outstanding during each year (in millions):
     1995--701.5; 1994--701.8; 1993--711.8. Including the effect of
     potentially dilutive securities, fully diluted earnings per common
     share amounts and increases were: 1995--$1.92, 18%; 1994--$1.63, 16%;
     1993--$1.41, 12%.

     PREFERRED STOCK
     In December 1992, the Company issued $500.0 million of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock; 10,000 preferred shares are equivalent to
     20.0 million depositary shares having a liquidation preference of
     $25.00 per depositary share. Each preferred share is entitled to one
     vote under certain circumstances and is redeemable at the option of
     the Company beginning on December 3, 1997, at its liquidation
     preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On June 30, 1995, the
     Company completed an exchange of approximately 5.2 million depositary
     shares, representing 2,600 shares of Series E 7.72% Cumulative
     Preferred Stock, for subordinated debt securities. In the third
     quarter of 1995, the Company repurchased approximately .5 million
     depositary shares equivalent to 250 shares of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock.
       In September 1989 and April 1991, the Company sold $200.0 million
     of Series B and $100.0 million of Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred
     Stock to the LESOP. The LESOP financed the purchase by issuing notes
     which are guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term
     debt, with an offsetting reduction in shareholders' equity. Each
     preferred share had a liquidation preference of $14.375 and $16.5625,
     respectively, and was convertible to a minimum of .7692 and .8 common
     share (conversion rate), respectively. Upon termination of employment,
     employees were guaranteed a minimum value payable in common shares
     equal to the greater of the conversion rate; the fair market value of
     their preferred shares; or the liquidation preference plus accrued
     dividends, not to exceed one common share. Each preferred share was
     entitled to one vote and was redeemable at the option of the Company.
     In 1992, 8.2 million Series B shares were converted into 6.4 million
     common shares. During 1995, the remaining 5.2 million Series B shares
     and 5.8 million Series C shares were converted into 8.7 million common
     shares.<PAGE>

     <PAGE> 56
     COMMON EQUITY PUT OPTIONS
     During May and June 1995, the Company sold 1.5 million common equity
     put options which expired unexercised in August and September. In
     August 1995, the Company sold .5 million common equity put options of
     which .4 million were exercised and .1 million expired unexercised in
     October 1995.
       In June 1994, the Company sold 2.0 million common equity put
     options which were exercised in November 1994. During November and
     December 1994, the Company sold an additional 2.0 million common
     equity put options which expired unexercised in February 1995. At
     December 31, 1994, the $56.2 million exercise price of these options
     was classified in common equity put options and the related offset was
     recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.
       In April 1993, 2.0 million common equity put options issued by the
     Company in December 1992, having an exercise price of $94.0 million,
     expired unexercised. In April 1993, the Company also sold 1.0 million
     common equity put options which expired unexercised in July 1993.

     SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
     In December 1988, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred
     Share Purchase Right (Right) on each outstanding share of common
     stock. Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to
     purchase one four-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
     Participating Preferred Stock (the economic equivalent of one common
     share) at an exercise price of $62.50 (which may be adjusted under
     certain circumstances), and is transferable apart from the common
     stock ten days following a public announcement that a person or group
     has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
     common shares (which threshold may be reduced by the Board of
     Directors to as low as 10%), or ten business days following the
     commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender or
     exchange offer resulting in beneficial ownership by a person or group
     exceeding the threshold.
       Once the threshold has been exceeded, or if the Company is acquired
     in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Right will
     entitle the holder, other than such person or group, to purchase at
     the then current exercise price, stock of the Company or the acquiring
     company having a market value of twice the exercise price.
       Each Right is nonvoting and expires on December 28, 1998, unless
     redeemed by the Company, at a price of $.0025, at any time prior to
     the public announcement that a person or group has exceeded the
     threshold. At December 31, 1995, 2.1 million shares of the Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance under
     this plan.

                 MCDONALD'S CORPORATION PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM


          History.  The McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing
     Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 1987 ("Profit
     Sharing Plan") and subsequently amended from time to time and the
     McDonald's Matching and Deferred Stock Ownership Plan, as amended and
     restated effective January 1, 1984 ("McDESOP") and subsequently
     amended from time to time, were merged, effective December 31, 1988,
     amended and restated effective January 1, 1989, and renamed the
     "McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program" (the "Program").  The
     Program was subsequently amended from time to time and was amended and
     restated effective July 1, 1992.  The McDonald's Stock Sharing Plan
     ("Stock Sharing Plan") was amended and restated effective January 1,
     1989.

          The Stock Sharing Plan was merged into the Program effece

     after the close of business on December 2199995.  After the merger,
     the Stock Sharing portion of the Program continued to be controlled by
     the McDonald's Stock Sharing Plan, as amended and restated effective
  JJaanuary 1, 1989 and the Profit Sharing portion of the Program
     continued to be controlled by the McDonald's Corporation Profit
     Sharing Program, as amended and restated effective January 1, 1992
     until January 1, 1996, the effective date of this restatement.  The
     assets of the McDonald's Stock Sharing Trust were transferred to the
     McDonald's Matching and Deferred Stock Ownership Trust on or after
     December 29, 1995 until such time as there were no remaining assets
     and the Trust ceased to exist.

          The Program is hereby amended and restated in one Plan document
     effective January 1, 1996, except as otherwise specifically provided
     herein.  

          Structure and Purpose.  The Program has four component portions,
     (1) the Profit Sharing Plan portion which is intended to be a profit
     sharing plan and to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a) of the
     Internal Revenue Code, (2) the McDESOP portion which is intended to
     meet the requirements for a stock bonus plan and a cash or deferred
     arrangement under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
     Code, (3) the Leveraged ESOP portion which is intended to meet the
     requirements of a stock bonus plan and a leveraged employee stock
     ownership plan under Sections 401(a) and 4975(e)(7) of the Internal
     Revenue Code and (4) the Stock Sharing portion which is intended to
     meet the requirements of a stock bonus plan and a tax credit ESOP in
      accordance with Sections 401(a) and 409 of the Internal Revenue Code
     and Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code before its repeal with
     respect to compensation paid or accrued after December 31, 1986.  Each
     portion of the Program shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
     with it meeting the requirements of the respective Internal Revenue
     Code Sections applicable thereto.  The assets of the Leveraged ESOP
     portion of the Program and the Stock Sharing portion of the Program
     shall be invested primarily in qualifying employer securities as
     defined in Section 409(l) of the Internal Revenue Code.

          Application of Provisions.  The purposes of the McDonald's
     Corporation Profit Sharing Program are to permit Participants (1) to
     share in the success of the Company by receiving a portion of its
     profits, (2) to provide employees a convenient means to save for their
     own future retirement security through their participation in this
     Program and (3) to provide Participants individually and as a group
      with a substantial ownership interest in the Company.

          Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Program as
     amended and restated herein applies to persons who are Employees on
     and after January 1, 1996.  Eligibility, benefits, payment of benefits
     and the amount of benefits, if any, of a person whose employment with
     an Employer terminated before January 1, 1996, and who is not rehired
     by an Employer on or after January 1, 1996, shall, except as otherwise
     specifically provided herein, be determined in accordance with the
     provisions of the Program, the Stock Sharing Plan, or of McDESOP and

                         by an Employer.

               In determining the number of such Hours of Service to be
               credited, the Plan Administrator shall make good faith

               store managers who are employed by such Licensee either in a
               restaurant or in connection with the operation of one or
               more restaurants as of the date of such acquisition and who
               continue to be employed by the Company or other Employer
               until June 30 of the Plan Year in which the acquisition
               occurred shall be credited by the Employer with his Hours of
               Service with such Licensee.  If a McDonald's Restaurant or
               group of restaurants operated by a Licensee is acquired by
               the Company or another Employer, during the Plan Year, each
               store manager who is employed by such Licensee either in a

               estimates based upon the available information and records
               including the estimated average number of hours per week for
               employees in a given job category.

               credited with the number of Hours of Service equal to the
               average number of Hours of Service per payroll period (not
               to exceed forty Hours of Service per week) of such Employee
               for the six calendar week period, or pertinent payroll
               period if such period is longer, ending immediately prior to
               the commencement of the Authorized Leave of Absence

               Participant is on an Authorized Leave of Absence on the last
               day of a Plan Year, the Hours of Service credited pursuant
               to the preceding sentence shall be counted for the purpose
               of determining whether he is an Active Participant under
               Sections 1.2(a) and (b) for such Plan Year.  Notwithstanding
               the foregoing, an Employee who fails either (A) to return to
               his employment within ninety (90) days after the expiration
               of an Authorized Leave of Absence, or (B) to remain in the
               employ of an Employer after the expiration of an Authorized
               Leave of Absence for the lesser of (i) a period equal to the
               period of his Authorized Leave of Absence or (ii) one year
               following his return to employment, unless such failure
               shall be due to death, Disability, illness, retirement on or
               after age 55 or the sale by the Company, one of its
               subsidiaries or affiliates of the McDonald's Restaurant in
               which such Employee is employed, shall be considered to have
               voluntarily terminated his employment as of the date the
               Leave of Absence commenced for purposes of determining Hours
               of Service for Eligibility Service and Credited Service.

               provisions of this Section 1.31 as if service with Corporate
               Systems, Inc. were service with the Company.  Such Hours of
               Service shall be credited using actual hours of service for
               hourly paid employees and using the service equivalencies
               provided in Section 1.31(e) for salaried employees.

               (c)  To the extent not otherwise credited in Section 1.31,

          of absence from work on account of Parental Leave, an Employee

               the Parental Leave.

               An Employee's Hours of Service for absence on account of
          Parental Leave shall not exceed the lesser of 501 Hours of
          Service or the number of Hours of Service needed to prevent a
          Break in Service and shall be credited to the Eligibility
          Computation Period (for purposes of crediting Eligibility
          Service) or the Plan Year (for purposes of crediting service
          other than Eligibility Service) in which absence because of a
          Parental Leave commenced; except that if such Hours of Service
          are not needed to prevent a Break in Service in the Eligibility

          the next following Eligibility Computation Period or Plan Year
          then, if needed to prevent a Break in Service, such Hours of
          Service shall be credited to the Eligibility Computation Period

         2.1   Participation.  Each person who was a Participant under the
     provisions of the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing Program or the
     McDonald's Stock Sharing Plan on the day before the Effective Date,
     shall continue to be a Participant hereunder.  Each other Employee
     shall become a Participant in the Program on the first Entry Date
     coinciding with or next following the date he completes one Year of
     Eligibility Service and attains age 21; provided that each Participant
     who is a certified swing manager, primary maintenance employee, crew
     member or other store hourly employee shall only become a Participant
     solely for purposes of the Profit Sharing Plan and the McDESOP
     portions of the Program.

          Admission to participation in the Program shall only be made when

     adopted by his Employer and no additional Participants shall enter the
     Stock Sharing portion of the Plan.

         2.2   Certification of Participation and Compensation to
     Committee.  Each Employer shall certify to the Committee, within a
     reasonable time before each Entry Date, the names of all new

     Elected Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions shall
     commence on the first day of the pay period in which the Participant
     completes One Year of Eligibility Service or as soon as 
     administratively feasible thereafter.  An Employee's "Retroactive
     Participation Date" is the date such Employee resumes employment.

          Upon a change in his employment status or resuming employment
     following a Termination of Employment which did not constitute a Break
     in Service, an Employee who was a Participant prior to a Termination
     of Employment shall be treated as an Active Participant from the day
     of his change in status or resumption of employment.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, a
     Rehired Employee who has a Participant Elected Contribution Account

         3.1   Profit Sharing Contributions.  Profit Sharing Contributions
     shall be made by Employers, as follows:

               (a)  Determination of Contribution.  The Board of Directors
          shall determine and certify to the Committee the amount, if any,
          of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions to be made to the
          Program by all Employers hereunder separately for (1) staff and
          executive employees or store managers and (2) Certified Swing
          Managers, primary maintenance employees, crew members and other
          hourly restaurant employees.  In its discretion, the Board of
          Directors may determine different amounts of contributions or
          contributions of different percentages of Considered Compensation
          for the groups identified in (1) and (2) of the preceding
          sentence.  Such determination shall be binding on all
          Participants, the Committee, the Company and the Other Employers.

               (b)  Employer's Shares of Profit Sharing Contributions. 
          Subject to Section 12.2, each Employer including the Company
          shall contribute for each Plan Year an amount equal to the sum of
          the Staff Contribution and the Crew Contribution as determined
          for such Employer below:

                    (1)  Staff Contribution.  The amount of an Employer's
               Staff Contribution shall equal the product of (A) the total
               Profit Sharing Contributions for the Plan Year for the
               Participants identified in Section 3.1(a)(1), as determined
               by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3.1(a),
               multiplied by (B) a fraction the numerator of which is the
               total Considered Compensation for such Plan Year of such
               Participants who are (i) Active Participants and
               (ii) Employees of such Employer and the denominator of which
               is the total Considered Compensation for the Plan Year of
               all Active Participants who are Employees, described in
               Section 3.1(a)(1), of all Employers; and

                    (2)  Crew Contribution.  The amount of an Employer's
               Crew Contribution shall equal the product of (A) the total
               Profit Sharing Contributions for the Plan Year for the
               Participants identified in Section 3.1(a)(2), as determined
               by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3.1(a),
               multiplied by (B) a fraction the numerator of which is the
               total Considered Compensation for such Plan Year of such
               Participants who are (i) Active Participants and
               (ii) Employees of such Employer and the denominator of which
               is the total Considered Compensation for the Plan Year of
               all Active Participants who are Employees, described in
               Section 3.1(a)(2), of all Employers.

         3.2   Payment of Contributions Made Pursuant to Article III.  The
     Employer Profit Sharing Contributions for each Plan Year shall be paid
     in cash or in securities of McDonald's Corporation, which are
     qualifying employer securities as defined in ERISA Section 407(d)(5)
     (which includes but is not limited to Company Stock), in full not
     later than the due date for filing the federal income tax return of
     the Employer for the tax year during which the last day of such Plan
     Year falls.

          Employer Profit Sharing Contributions, if any, for each Plan Year
     shall be held in the Profit Sharing Holding Fund and, if contributed
     in cash, invested in the STIF Fund or, if contributed as qualifying
     employer securities, remain invested in qualifying employer securities
     until February 1 following the Plan Year or, if not administratively
     feasible, as soon thereafter as administrative requirements may
     warrant, at which time the Committee shall allocate such amounts to
     Participants' Profit Sharing Accounts and invest them in accordance
     with Section 10.7, 10.8 or 10.9(a), as applicable.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  McDESOP and LEVERAGED EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

         4.1   Amount of Employer Matching Contributions.  Employer
     Matching Contributions shall be made by Employers as specified in (a),
     subject to the limitations specified in (b), as follows:

               (a)  Employer Matching Contributions.  For each Plan Year,
          each Employer shall contribute to the Trust as Employer Matching 
          Contributions an amount equal to (i) the Matching Amount reduced
          by (ii) the Forfeiture Amount, as defined below:

                    (1)  The Matching Amount shall equal fifty percent (or
               such greater percentage as the Board of Directors from time
               to time determines) of the sum of all Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions (excluding Special Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions as described in Section 5.1) for the
               Plan Year made for Active Participants who are employed by
               that Employer.  If the Forfeiture Amount for a Plan Year is
               greater than the Matching Amount, the Matching Amount shall
               equal the Forfeiture Amount plus any Employer Matching
               Contributions made to the Trust by the Employers for such
               Plan Year.

                    (2)  The Forfeiture Amount shall equal (A) the amount
               of Forfeitures which occur during a Plan Year pursuant to
               Sections 11.4(c) and 16.6 after any charges to Forfeitures
               provided hereunder, (B) multiplied by a fraction the
               numerator of which is the amount of Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions (excluding Special Participant Elected
               Matched Contributions) made for Active Participants who are
               Employees of such Employer and the denominator of which is
               the total amount of Participant Elected Matched
               Contributions (excluding Special Participant Elected Matched
               Contributions) made for Active Participants for the Plan
               Year.

               (b)  Average Actual Contribution Percentage.  The average
          actual contribution percentage ("Average ACP") for a specified
          group of Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the
          actual contribution percentages of the persons in such group.  A
          Participant's actual contribution percentage is equal to the
          product of (1) 100 multiplied by (2) the quotient of (A) the sum
          of Employer Matching Contributions (including any Forfeitures
          allocated therewith), and Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contributions and such amount of Participant Elected
          Contributions actually paid to the Trust for each such Employee
          for such Plan Year divided by (B) the Employee's Considered
          Compensation for the Plan Year ("Actual Contribution
          Percentage").  As soon as practicable after the end of the Plan
          Year, the Committee shall calculate the Average ACP for the Plan
          Year for the group of Employees eligible to be Active
          Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees and for the
          group of such Employees who are Non-highly Compensated Employees.

               Solely for purposes of the Average ACP test the Committee
          shall have the discretion to determine the portion of a
          Participant's (or selected group of Participant's) Employer
          Matching Contributions (and Forfeitures), Special Section 401(k)
          Employer Contributions or Participant Elected Contributions to be
          counted in calculating the Participant's average contribution
          percentage and in making such determination shall be under no
          obligation to treat similarly situated Participants in a like
          manner so long as the following requirements (to the extent
          applicable) are satisfied:

                    (1)  The amount of Special Section 401(k) Employer
               Contributions is non-discriminatory under Code Section
               401(a)(4);

                    (2)  The amount of Participant Elected Contributions,
               including any Participant Elected Contributions counted for
               purposes in calculating Participants' average contribution
               percentages, shall satisfy the requirements of Code Section
               401(k)(3);

                    (3)  The Special Section 401(k) Contributions are
               allocated to the Participant as of a date within the Plan
               Year and the Participant Elective Contributions satisfy the
               requirements of Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(b)(4)(i) for
               the Plan Year.

               A Participant's Employer Matching Contributions, Special
          Section 401(k) Contributions or Participant Elected Contributions
          which are counted for purposes of the Required ADP Test pursuant
          to Section 5.2(e) shall not be counted for purposes of
          calculating such Participant's average contribution percentage.

               (c)  Required Actual Contribution Percentage Test and
          Adjustment.  The Average ACP for the group of Highly Compensated
          Employees eligible to be Active Participants for any Plan Year
          shall not exceed both (1) and (2) ("Required ACP Test") as
          follows:

                    (1)  the Average ACP for the group of Participants who
               are Non-highly Compensated Employees multiplied by 1.25, and

                    (2)  the lesser of (A) the Average ACP for the group of
               Employees eligible to be Active Participants who are Non-
               highly Compensated Employees multiplied by 2 or (B) such
               Average ACP for such Employees plus 2%.

          If the Required ACP Test for a Plan Year is not met and, if the
          Company does not elect to make Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contributions with respect to the Plan Year sufficient to result
          in the Average ACP of the Highly Compensated Employees not
          exceeding the amounts in both Sections 4.1(c)(1) and (c)(2), then
          the Committee shall reduce Employer Matching Contributions
          including any Forfeitures allocated therewith which may be
          allocated to Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees to
          the highest percentage of Considered Compensation which results
          in the Average ACP of Highly Compensated Employees not exceeding
          the amounts in both Section 4.1(c)(1) or (c)(2) above.  The
          Committee shall reduce and distribute such excess Employer
          Matching Contributions including any Forfeitures allocated
          therewith and any income, gains or losses attributable thereto,
          as determined in accordance with Section 5.3, to Highly
          Compensated Employees by first reducing and distributing the
          Employer Matching Contributions including any Forfeitures
          allocated therewith of such Participants with the highest Actual
          Contribution Percentage to equal that of the Highly Compensated 
          Employee with the next highest Actual Contribution Percentage and
          repeating such reductions until the Average ACP for the Highly
          Compensated Employees does not exceed both the amounts in
          Sections 4.1(c)(1) or (c)(2) above.  The Committee shall make any
          distributions necessary for the Program to meet the Required ACP
          Test after the end of the Plan Year with respect to which such
          reduced Employer Matching Contributions including any Forfeitures
          allocated therewith were made and, if reasonably possible, by
          March 15 following the end of such Plan Year but, in any event,
          not later than by the end of the following Plan Year.

         4.2   Leveraged ESOP Contributions.  Leveraged ESOP Contributions
     shall be made by Employers, as follows:

               (a)  Company Leveraged ESOP Contributions.  For each Plan
          Year that a loan authorized under Section 6.1 remains unpaid, the
          Company shall contribute in cash to the Trust, as Leveraged ESOP
          Contributions, such amounts (if any) as shall be determined by
          the Board of Directors, provided, however, the Company's
          Leveraged ESOP Contribution in cash for any Plan Year shall not
          be less than the product of:

                    (1)  the installment (if any) payable on such loan
               reduced by the dividends on unallocated shares of Company
               Stock (including Company Stock into which such shares have
               been converted) held in the suspense account associated with
               such loan (or any loan refinanced with such loan), dividends
               on allocated shares of Company Stock (including Company
               Stock into which such shares have been converted) held in
               Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts acquired with the
               proceeds of such loan (or any Loan refinanced with such
               loan) and earnings attributable to such dividends and to
               Leveraged ESOP Contributions made to repay such loan;
               multiplied by

                    (2)  a fraction, the numerator of which is the
               Considered Compensation paid by the Company to Employees for
               the Plan Year paid while they were Active Participants and
               the denominator of which is the Considered Compensation for
               the Plan Year paid to all Employees while they were Active
               Participants.

          If no installment (as drawn or renegotiated) is payable on a loan
          for the Plan Year, no Leveraged ESOP Contribution shall be
          required with respect to such loan for the Plan Year, except as
          otherwise determined by the Board of Directors.  The dividends on
          allocated shares of Company Stock held in Participants' Leveraged
          ESOP Accounts acquired with the proceeds of a loan or any loan
          refinanced with such loan (or shares into which such Company
          Stock has been converted) shall be included in Section 4.2(a)(1)
          only to the extent that Employer Contributions and the dividends
          and other income attributable to unallocated shares held in the
          suspense account associated with such loan are less than the
          installments payable or to be payable with respect to such loan.

               (b)  Leveraged ESOP Contributions by Other Employers.  Each
          Employer that has adopted the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Plan
          (other than the Company) shall contribute to the Trust an amount
          equal to the product of:

                    (1)  the total Considered Compensation for the Plan
               Year paid by such Employer to Employees while they were
               Active Participants; multiplied by

                    (2)  a fraction the numerator of which is the Leveraged
               ESOP Contribution of the Company for the Plan Year and the
               denominator of which is the Considered Compensation paid by
               the Company to Employees while they were Active
               Participants.

               (c)  Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions.  The Board of
          Directors may, in its discretion, determine that Additional
          leveraged ESOP Contributions shall be made for a Plan Year in
          Company Stock and designate such contributions as Per Capita
          Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions or Compensation Based
          Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions (collectively called
          "Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions").  The Company shall
          make such Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions in an amount
          equal to the total Additional Leveraged ESOP Contribution
          multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Considered
          Compensation paid by the Company to Employees for the Plan Year
          paid while they were Active Participants and the denominator of
          which is the Considered Compensation for the Plan Year paid to
          all Employees while they were Active Participants.

               Each Employer that has adopted the Leveraged ESOP (other
          than the Company) shall contribute to the Trust as Additional
          Leveraged ESOP Contributions an amount equal to the product of
          the total Considered Compensation for the Plan Year paid by such
          Employer to Employees while they were Active Participants
          multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Company's
          Additional Leveraged ESOP Contribution and the denominator of
          which is the Compensation paid by the Company to Employees while
          they were Active Participants.

               (d)  Special Dividend Replacement Contributions.  The Board
          of Directors may, in its discretion, determine that Special
          Dividend Replacement Contributions shall be made as of any
          Valuation Date in an amount not to exceed the dividends with
          respect to Company Stock allocated to Participant's Leveraged
          ESOP Accounts which are used pursuant to Section 6.3(b).  Each
          Employer shall make any such Special Dividend Replacement
          Contributions in an amount equal to the total amount of such
          contributions to be made as of a Valuation Date multiplied by a
          fraction the numerator of which is the Considered Compensation
          paid to Active Participants who are Employees of the Employer for
          the calendar quarter ending on the Valuation Date and the
          denominator of which is the Considered Compensation paid to all
          Active Participants during the calendar quarter ending on the
          Valuation Date.

         4.3   Annual Employer Contribution Elections.

               (a)  Minimum and Maximum Amount of Participant Elected
          Matched Contributions.  If Participant Elected Matched
          Contributions (in addition to Special Participant Elected Matched
          Contributions made prior to January 1, 1993) are to be permitted
          for all or any portion of a Plan Year, the Company by action of
          its Board of Directors shall specify for the Plan Year or portion
          of the Plan Year, the amount (either as a dollar amount or a
          percentage of each Active Participant's Considered Compensation)
          of such Participant Elected Matched Contributions ("Specified
          Participant Elected Matched Contributions") which shall be made
          on behalf of an Active Participant in the absence of a contrary
          election by the Participant and may also specify, the minimum and
          maximum amounts of Participant Elected Matched Contributions
          which a Participant may elect in lieu of Specified Participant
          Elected Matched Contributions (either as a dollar amount or a
          percentage of each Participant's Considered Compensation) for the
          Plan Year or portion of the Plan Year as permitted by procedures
          established by the Plan Administrator, provided that such minimum
          and maximum amounts shall be not greater for any Plan Year than:

                    (1)  six percent (6%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a staff or an executive
               employee or a store manager,

                    (2)  ten percent (10%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a Certified Swing Manager
               or primary maintenance employee, and

                    (3)  eight percent (8%) of the Participant's Considered
               Compensation if the Participant is a crew member or other
               hourly restaurant employee.

               (b)  Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions.  For
          each Plan Year, the Company may elect to have the Company and the
          other Employers make a Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contribution to the Program in such amount (if any) as the Board
          of Directors may determine, which shall be allocated pursuant to
          Section 7.2(b) to the Employer Matching Contribution Accounts of
          those Active Participants who for the Plan Year are Non-highly
          Compensated Employees who have Compensation reduction elections
          in effect.  In any Plan Year in which the Company elects to have
          such a Special Section 401(k) Employer Contribution made, each
          Employer, including the Company, shall contribute a fractional
          portion of the Special Section 401(k) Employer Contribution, in
          an amount equal to the Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contribution multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
          the amount of Participant Elected Contributions for such Plan
          Year of those Active Participants who are employed by the
          Employer and who are Non-highly Compensated Employees, and the
          denominator of which is the amount of Participant Elected
          Contributions for the Plan Year of all Active Participants who
          are Non-highly Compensated Employees.

         4.4   Additional Employer Contributions.  For such Plan Years, if
     any, as the Board of Directors shall direct, the Employers shall make
     Additional Employer Contributions in an amount to be determined by the
     Board of Directors.  Each such Employer shall contribute Additional
     Employer Contributions to the Trust for a Plan Year in an amount equal
     to the total Additional Employer Contributions for such Plan Year
     multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
     Active Participants eligible to receive Additional Employer
     Contributions who are Employees of the Employer and the denominator of
     which is the total number of Active Participants eligible to receive
     Additional Employer Contributions.

         4.5   Payment of Contributions Made Pursuant to Article IV. 
     Employer Contributions for each Plan Year made in accordance with
     Article IV, except for Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions
     as provided in Section 4.3(b), shall be delivered to the Trustee on or
     before the due date for the filing of the federal income tax return
     (including any extensions) of the Employer for the tax year during
     which the last day of such Plan Year occurs.  Special Section 401(k)
     Employer Contributions for a Plan Year may be made during the Plan
     Year or at any time on or before the last day of the following Plan
     Year.

          Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated
     therewith, Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions and
     Additional Employer Contributions shall be invested in the McDESOP
     McDonald's Common Stock Fund and held in the McDESOP and Leveraged
     ESOP Holding Fund until allocated to Participant's Accounts as
     provided in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b) and 7.2(c), respectively. 
     Participant Elected Contributions shall be invested in the McDESOP
     McDonald's Common Stock Fund and held in the McDESOP and Leveraged
     ESOP Holding Fund until credited to Participant's Accounts as provided
     in Section 7.4.

         4.6   Form of Contributions.  Except as otherwise provided,
     Employer Contributions to the McDESOP Trust shall be either in cash or
     in Company Stock, as each Employer shall determine in its discretion.

                                   ARTICLE V

                       PARTICIPANT ELECTED CONTRIBUTIONS

         5.1   Participant Elected Contributions.  Each Active Participant,
     who is employed by an Employer, shall have his Considered Compensation
     reduced for each Plan Year or designated portion of a Plan Year by an
     amount equal to the Specified Participant Elected Matched Contribution
     for the Plan Year or designated portion of a Plan Year, as provided in
     Section 4.3(a), which amount his Employer shall contribute to the
     McDESOP Trust on the Participant's behalf as a Participant Elected
     Matched Contribution, unless the Participant shall elect, on such
     form, at such time and in such manner as the Committee shall specify,
     not to have his Considered Compensation so reduced or (subject to the
     minimum and maximum amounts of reduction specified for the Plan Year
     pursuant to Section 4.3(a)) reduced by a lesser or greater amount. In
     addition, each Active Participant may elect in writing on forms
     approved by the Committee to have his Employer contribute to the 
     McDESOP Trust on the Participant's behalf as Participant Elected
     Unmatched Contributions an amount equal to any additional amount by
     which the Participant elects to have his Considered Compensation
     reduced (which election may be a larger percentage for certain
     Considered Compensation during a Plan Year, e.g. bonus, and a smaller
     percentage for other Considered Compensation, e.g. salary, as the
     Committee shall permit), provided that such amount may not exceed
     seven percent (7%) of his Considered Compensation for a Plan Year and
     further provided that an Active Participant may elect Participant
     Elected Unmatched Contributions as provided above regardless of
     whether the Participant is making Participant Elected Matched
     Contributions for that period. The Committee may from time to time
     establish general policies requiring Participants to elect Participant
     Elected Matched Contributions up to a specified level before electing
     any Participant Elected Unmatched Contributions.

          At each quarterly Valuation Date, the amount of a Participant's
     Participant Elected Matched Contributions shall be redetermined by
     recharacterizing any Participant Elected Unmatched Contributions as
     Participant Elected Matched Contributions to the extent in the Plan
     Year to date taking into account all of the Participant's Participant
     Elected Matched Contributions and his Considered Compensation in the
     Plan Year through the Valuation Date, the Participant has not made the
     maximum permitted Participant Elected Matched Contributions for
     Participants in the same category as the Participant.  Notwithstanding
     any provision herein to the contrary, the amount of a Participant's
     Participant Elected Contributions for any calendar year shall not
     exceed an amount or percentage which from time to time is established
     by the Committee or the Board of Directors, nor a pro rata portion of
     said amount for any partial calendar year of contributions.

          Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, a Participant
     may make, change or revoke a Compensation reduction election at such
     times and in such manner as the Committee may permit, provided that
     any such election, change or revocation shall apply solely to
     Considered Compensation, which is not currently available to the
     Participant as of the date of such election, change or revocation. 
     The Compensation reduction election by the Active Participant which is
     in accordance with the Program shall continue in effect,
     notwithstanding any change in Considered Compensation, until he shall
     change such Compensation reduction election or until he shall cease to
     be an Active Participant.  If a Participant has an election pursuant
     to the McDonald's 1989 Executive Equalization Plan ("McCap I") or the
     McDonald's Supplemental Employee Benefit Equalization Plan
     ("McCap II") in effect for a calendar year, the Participant's
     Compensation reduction election hereunder may not be changed for such
     year but may only be changed before the beginning of the following
     Plan Year for such Plan Year.  Each Employer shall make Participant
     Elected Contributions to the Trustee on behalf of each Active
     Participant employed by the Employer in the amount by which the
     Participant's Considered Compensation was reduced pursuant to this
     Section 5.1.

         5.2   Restrictions on Participant Elected Contributions. 
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1, the following
     restrictions shall apply to Participant Elected Contributions:

               (a)  No Participant Compensation reduction election shall be
          solicited or accepted from any Participant and no Participant
          Elected Contributions shall be made on behalf of any Participant
          unless and until a registration statement under the Securities
          Act of 1933 has become effective with respect to securities
          offered in connection with the Program, unless in the opinion of
          counsel for the Company such registration statement is not
          required;

               (b)  No Compensation reduction election shall be solicited
          or accepted from any Participant who resides or works in any
          state and no Participant Elected Contributions shall be made on
          behalf of any Participant who resides or works in any state
          unless and until the Program shall have complied with applicable
          securities and blue sky laws of the state or in the opinion of
          counsel of the Company is exempt from such law; and

               (c)  (1)  The sum of Participant Elected Contributions and
               of elected deferrals under any Related Defined Contribution
               Plan for any Participant shall in no event exceed a maximum
               of $9,500 (in 1996 as adjusted from time to time, in
               accordance with Section 402(g)(5) of the Internal Revenue
               Code) for a calendar year ("Maximum Elective Deferral
               Amount").

                    (2)  If the Participant notifies the Committee in
               writing by March 1 following the Plan Year or such later
               date not later than the April 15 following the Plan Year as
               the Committee shall permit, that the sum of his elective
               contributions to a simplified employer pension, to a 403(b)
               plan (as defined in Section 402(g)(3) of the Internal
               Revenue Code), or to any qualified cash or deferred
               arrangement (as defined in Section 401(k) of the Internal
               Revenue Code) exceeds the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount
               ("Excess Elected Deferrals"), such portion of the
               Participant's Participant Elected Contributions as the
               Participant shall elect in such notice not to exceed the
               amount of such Excess Elected Deferrals (including any
               income allocated thereto as determined in accordance with
               Section 5.3) shall be distributed to the Participant not
               later than the April 15 following the Plan Year.  In
               determining whether a Participant has made Excess Elected
               Deferrals under this Section 5.2(c)(2), if a Participant is
               a participant in any plan described in Section 403(b) of the
               Internal Revenue Code under which he makes elective
               deferrals, the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount shall be
               increased in accordance with the provisions of Sections
               402(g)(4) and 402(g)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code with
               respect to any Participant who participates in a plan
               described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code or
               who is a qualified employee in a plan of a qualified
               organization (as defined in Section 402(g)(8) of the
               Internal Revenue Code) for a calendar year.

                    (3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant
               has elected to participate in McCAP I or McCAP II as
               provided therein his Compensation reduction elections
               hereunder shall be irrevocable to the extent provided in
               Section 5.1 and any amount of such deferrals which shall be
               in excess of the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount and any
               Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures
               allocated therewith shall not be contributed hereunder but
               shall be credited to the Participant's account under McCAP I
               or McCAP II, as applicable, to the extent provided
               thereunder and further provided that no such amount shall be
               credited to a Participant under more than one of the
               McDonald's Profit Sharing Program Equalization Plan
               ("McEqual"), McCAP I and McCAP II or any other non-qualified
               deferred compensation plan from time to time maintained by
               the Company.

                    (4)  If a Participant is not eligible to or has not
               elected to participate in McCAP I or McCAP II as provided
               therein and has Compensation reduction elections in excess
               of the Maximum Elective Deferral Amount hereunder, such
               Participant Elected Contributions shall not be contributed
               to the Program nor shall such Participant be credited with
               any Participant Elected Contributions or Employer Matching
               Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith under
               McCAP I or McCAP II, as applicable, for the Plan Year.

                    (5)  In determining whether the Maximum Elective
               Deferral Amount has been exceeded, the Plan Administrator
               may count Participant Elected Contributions toward the limit
               in the order contributed to the Program, may apply the
               Maximum Elective Deferral Amount on a pro rata basis to
               periods specified by the Plan Administrator or such other
               approach as the Plan Administrator shall reasonably
               determine.

               (d)  Average Actual Deferral Percentage.  The average Actual
          Deferral Percentage ("Average ADP") for a specified group of
          Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the Actual
          Deferral Percentages of the members of such group.  The Actual
          Deferral Percentage of an individual is the amount of his
          Participant Elected Contributions (excluding for each Non-highly
          Compensated Employee any such contributions in excess of the
          Maximum Elective Deferral Amount as defined in Section 5.2(c)(1))
          and such amount of Employer Matching Contributions and Special
          Section 401(k) Employer Contributions, actually paid to the Trust
          for each such Employee for such Plan Year divided by the
          Employee's Considered Compensation for the Plan Year ("Actual
          Deferral Percentage").  As soon as practicable after the end of
          the Plan Year, the Committee shall calculate the Average ADP for
          the Plan Year for the group of Participants who are Highly
          Compensated Employees and for the group of Participants who are
          Non-highly Compensated Employees.

               Solely for purposes of calculating the Average ADP the
          Committee shall have the discretion to determine the portion of a
          Participant's (or selected group of Participant's) Participant
          Elected Contributions, Employer Matching Contributions or Special
          Section 401(k) Employer Contributions to be counted in
          calculating the Participant's Actual Deferral Percentage and in
          making such determination shall be under no obligation to treat
          similarly situated Participants in a like manner so long as the
          following requirements (to the extent applicable) are satisfied:

                    (1)  The amount of Special Section 401(k) Employer
               Contributions treated as Participant Elected Contributions
               for purposes of calculating the Average Deferral Percentage
               shall satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a)(4);

                    (2)  The amount of Special Section 401(k) Employer
               Contributions treated as Participant Elected Contributions
               for purposes of the ADP test and those Special Section
               401(k) Contributions counted in the calculation of the ACP
               Test satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4);
               and

                    (3)  The Special Section 401(k) Contributions are
               allocated to Participant's Net Balance Account under the
               Program as of the last day of the Plan Year for which the
               ADP test is being calculated.

               (e)  Required ADP Test and Adjustment.  The Average ADP for
          a group of Highly Compensated Employees eligible to be Active
          Participants for any Plan Year shall not exceed both (1) and (2)
          ("Required ADP Test") below:

                    (1)  the Average ADP for the group of Active
               Participants who are Non-highly Compensated Employees
               multiplied by 1.25, and

                    (2)  the lesser of (A) the Average ADP for Active
               Participants who are Non-highly Compensated Employees
               multiplied by 2 or (B) such Average ADP for such Active
               Participants plus 2%.

               If the Required ADP Test for a Plan Year is not met and, if
          the Company does not elect to make Special Section 401(k)
          Contributions with respect to the Plan Year sufficient to result
          in the Average ADP of the Highly Compensated Employees not
          exceeding both the amounts in Sections 5.2(e)(1) and (e)(2), then
          the Committee shall reduce, in accordance with Section 5.5,
          Participant Elected Contributions (and any Employer Matching
          Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith allocated
          with respect thereto) that Active Participants or a portion of
          the Active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees may
          defer so that the Average ADP of Highly Compensated Employees
          does not exceed the amounts in Sections 5.2(e)(1) and (e)(2).

               The Committee shall reduce and distribute such excess
          Participant Elected Contributions and any income, gains or losses
          attributable thereto, as determined in accordance with
          Section 5.3, to Highly Compensated Employees by first reducing 
          the Participant Elected Contributions (and any Employer Matching
          Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith) of such
          Participants with the highest Actual Deferral Percentage to equal
          that of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest
          Actual Deferral Percentage and repeating such reductions until
          the ADP for the Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the
          amounts in both Section 5.2(e)(1) and (e)(2) above.  The
          Committee shall distribute such reduced Participant Elected
          Contributions and any income allocable thereto after the end of
          the Plan Year with respect to which such reduced Participant
          Elected Contributions were made and, if reasonably possible, by
          March 15 following the end of such Plan Year but, in any event,
          not later than by the end of the following Plan Year.  If
          Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated
          therewith are included in calculating the ADP for a Plan Year,
          any such contributions reduced hereunder shall be distributed to
          Participants in the same manner as Participant Elected
          Contributions are distributed (including any income allocable
          thereto).  If Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures
          allocated therewith are not included in calculating the ADP for
          Plan Year, any amount of Employer Matching Contributions and any
          forfeitures allocated therewith reduced hereunder because such
          contributions were originally allocated with respect to
          Participant Elected Matched Contributions which are reduced to
          meet the Required ADP Test shall become a Forfeiture and shall be
          allocated to other Participant's Employer Matching Contribution
          Accounts in proportion to the Employer Matching Contributions and
          any Forfeitures allocated therewith to such accounts pursuant to
          Sections 7.2(a) and (d).

         5.3   Allocation of Income to Certain Distributed Amounts. 
     Income, gains and losses equal to the sum of the amounts determined
     under (a) below shall be allocated to and distributed with any amounts
     distributed to a Participant pursuant to Sections 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or
     5.4 as follows:

               (a)  Income for Plan Year.  Income, gains and losses for a
          completed Plan Year with respect to contributions distributed in
          accordance with Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4 shall equal the
          income, gains and losses for the Plan Year allocable to a
          Participant's Account for such contributions (taking the
          contributions allocated to each different type of Account,
          separately) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
          the amount of such contributions so distributed and the
          denominator of which is the total of such Account balance as of
          the last day of the Plan Year reduced by all earnings and gains
          and increased by all expenses and losses allocable to such
          Account for the Plan Year.

               (b)  Allocation of Distributed Income to Accounts.  Income,
          gains and losses distributed with any amounts distributed to a
          Participant pursuant to Sections 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4 shall
          reduce the income, gains and losses allocated to a Participant's
          Participant Elected Contribution Account or Employer Matching
          Contribution Account, in accordance with Section 10.13, in an 
          amount equal to the total amount of such income, gains and losses
          distributed.

         5.4   Multiple Use of Alternative Limitations.  If after any
     reductions provided for in Sections 4.1(c) and 5.2(e) are made, the
     ACP of Highly Compensated Employees exceeds the amount in Section
     4.1(c)(1) but does not exceed the lesser of the amounts in Section
     4.1(c)(2) and the Average ADP of Highly Compensated Employees exceeds
     the amount in Section 5.2(e)(1) but does not exceed the lesser of the
     amounts in Section 5.2(e)(2), the sum of the Average ADP and the
     Average ACP, for a Plan Year, of the Highly Compensated Employees who
     are Active Participants (i) shall not exceed the greater of (a) or
     (b), where: 

               (a)  equals the sum of (1) plus (2) where:

                    (1)  is one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of
               the greater of (A) the Average ADP for such Plan Year of the
               Non-Highly Compensated Employees who are Active
               Participants, or (B) the Average ACP for such Plan Year of
               such Non-Highly Compensated Employees; and

                    (2)  is two percent plus the lesser of the amount
               determined under Section 5.4(a)(1)(A) or the amount
               determined under Section 5.4(a)(1)(B), but in no event shall
               this amount exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the lesser
               of the amounts determined under Section 5.4(a)(1)(A) or
               5.4(a)(1)(B); and

               (b)  equals the sum of (1) plus (2) where

                    (1)  is one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of
               the lesser of (A) the Average ADP for such Plan Year of the
               Non-Highly Compensated Employees who are Active
               Participants, or (B) the Average ACP for such Plan Year of
               such Non-Highly Compensated Employees; and

                    (2)  is two percent plus the greater of the amount
               determined under Section 5.4(b)(1)(A) or 5.4(b)(1)(B).  In
               no event, however, shall this amount exceed 200 percent of
               the greater of the amounts determined under
               Section 5.4(b)(1)(A) or 5.4(b)(1)(B).

     The Committee may establish, from time to time, such rules,
     restrictions and limitations as it may deem appropriate to insure that
     the above limitations are met.  If the Committee determines that the
     reduction or disallowance of Employer Matching Contributions and any
     Forfeitures allocated therewith, Participant elections or Participant
     Elected Contributions is necessary or desirable with respect to Highly
     Compensated Employees, the Committee may reduce or disallow Employer
     Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith or
     Participant Elected Contributions and the income, gains and losses
     thereon as determined pursuant to Section 5.3 for such Highly
     Compensated Employees, including elections for Participant Elected
     Contributions or such contributions and Employer Matching 
     Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith already made for
     the Plan Year, as provided in Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.5.

         5.5   Excess Compensation Reduction Elections.  Participant
     Elected Contributions for any Participant or group of Participants
     shall not exceed the maximum amounts permitted under Sections 4.1(c),
     5.2(e) and 5.4, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
      If any amounts of Employer Matching Contributions and any Forfeitures
     allocated therewith of any Participant or group of Participants are
     determined by the Committee to be in excess of the amounts permitted
     under Section 4.1(c) or 5.4, or if any amounts of Participant Elected
     Contributions for any Participant or group of Participants are
     determined by the Committee to be in excess of the amounts permitted
     under Section 5.2(e) or 5.4 and if the Company has not elected to make
     Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions with respect to the Plan
     Year sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e)
     or 5.4 or if the Committee reasonably expects that Employer Matching
     Contributions and any Forfeitures allocated therewith or Participant
     Elected Contributions will be in excess of the amounts permitted under
     Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4, the Committee may apply one or both of
     (a) and (b) below to the extent the Committee, in its discretion,
     reasonably estimates to be necessary to satisfy Section 4.1(c), 5.2(e)
     or 5.4.

               (a)  Restrictions on Participant Elected Contributions.  The
          Committee may reduce prospectively the amount of the Participant
          Elected Contributions which may be made by an Employer to the
          McDESOP Trust on behalf of an Active Participant or any specified
          group of Active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees
          by reducing the future contributions made with respect to such
          Participant's or Participants' elections to the extent the
          Committee reasonably determines it is necessary to satisfy
          Section 5.2(e) or 5.4.  In making reductions to future
          Participant Elected Contributions hereunder the Committee,
          generally, shall have no obligation to treat similarly situated
          Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees in the same
          manner and, particularly, shall not be obligated to reduce
          Participant's future elections in any particular systematic
          manner based upon the amount of Participant Elected Contributions
          already made for the Plan Year, the percentage of a Participant's
          Considered Compensation which Participant Elected Contributions
          constitute, or the amount or percentage of Considered
          Compensation which a Participant's effective Participant Elected
          Contribution election constitutes. 

               (b)  Staggered and Limited Elections for Highly Compensated
          Employees.  The Committee may, in accordance with uniform and
          non-discriminatory rules it establishes from time to time,
          require that Active Participants who are among the Highly
          Compensated Employees for the Plan Year make Compensation
          reduction elections following and/or preceding the completion of
          such elections by Employees who are Non-highly Compensated
          Employees and the Committee may (1) limit the amount by which
          each Participant who is among the Highly Compensated Employees
          may elect to reduce his Considered Compensation, and (2) permit
          each Employee who is a Non-highly Compensated Employee to elect 
          to reduce his Considered Compensation within higher limits than
          those for Highly Compensated Employees.

               (c)  Estimated Compensation.  For the purposes of
          Section 5.5(a) and (b), Employers are permitted to determine that
          Participants are Highly Compensated Employees or Non-highly
          Compensated Employees based on the Participant's Considered
          Compensation for the immediately preceding Plan Year or estimated
          Considered Compensation for the current Plan Year in accordance
          with uniform and nondiscriminatory rules whenever information
          regarding actual Considered Compensation for the Plan Year is not
          reasonably available at the time the amount of a contribution
          hereunder is determined or limited; provided that subsequent
          adjustments shall be made, as necessary, to the extent such
          estimates prove to be incorrect.

         5.6   Deadline for Participant Elected Contributions.  Each
     Employer shall contribute on behalf of each Active Participant the
     Participant Elected Contributions for each Plan Year to the Trustee as
     soon as administratively possible as of the earliest date on which
     such contributions can reasonably be segregated from the Employer's
     general assets but not later than the earlier of (1) 90 days from the
     date on which such amounts would otherwise have been payable to the
     Active Participant in cash or (2) the end of the twelve-month period
     immediately following the last day of such Plan Year or by such later
     date as may be permitted under applicable law, Treasury Regulations
     and Rulings of the Internal Revenue Service.

         5.7   Application of the Limitations of Sections 5.2(c), 5.2(e),
     4.1(c), 5.4 and 9.1.  Section 5.2(c) shall be first applied to
     contributions under the Program, secondly, Section 5.2(e) shall be
     applied to contributions under the Program, thirdly, Section 4.1(c)
     shall be applied to contributions under the Program, fourthly,
     Section 5.4 shall be applied to contributions under the Program, and
     lastly, Section 9.1 shall be applied to contributions under the
     Program.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                           LEVERAGED ESOP PROVISIONS

         6.1   Power to Borrow.  The Board of Directors in its discretion
     may authorize the Trustee of the Trust to borrow funds on behalf of
     the Program for the purpose of purchasing Company Stock and for making
     repayment of outstanding loans, the proceeds of which have been used
     to purchase Company Stock and for which the Program is liable.  In the
     event the Trustee's borrowing shall cause a lending of money or other
     extension of credit to be made between the Program and a Disqualified
     Person or a Party in Interest or, if in connection with such
     borrowing, a Disqualified Person or Party in Interest shall guarantee
     a loan or other extension of credit to the Program, such loan or other
     extension of credit to the Program shall, as an "Exempt Loan," meet
     the requirements of Section 4975(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
     and Section 408(b)(3) of ERISA and regulations thereunder, which
     include the following:

               (a)  The loan shall be for a specific term and not payable
          upon demand except in the event of default;

               (b)  The loan is primarily for the benefit of Participants
          and Beneficiaries, at a reasonable rate of interest, and under
          terms at the time the loan is made which are at least as
          favorable to the Program as the terms of a comparable loan
          resulting from arms-length negotiations between independent
          parties;

               (c)  The proceeds of the loan must be used within a
          reasonable time after their receipt to acquire Company Stock or
          for making repayment of an outstanding Exempt Loan;

               (d)  The loan shall be without recourse against the Program
          and collateral for the loan shall be limited to the shares of
          Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of the loan (or Company
          Stock into which such shares have been converted) or used as
          collateral on an outstanding Exempt Loan which is being repaid
          with the proceeds of the loan.  No person entitled to payment
          under the loan shall have any right to any assets of the Program
          other than the collateral, Leveraged ESOP Contributions
          (excluding contributions of Company Stock), earnings on such
          collateral and contributions (including but not limited to
          dividends paid on unallocated Company Stock held in the Leveraged
          ESOP Suspense Account) and dividends on Company Stock (or Company
          Stock into which such shares have been converted) acquired with
          the loan proceeds and held in Participants' Leveraged ESOP
          Accounts;

               (e)  In the event of a default upon the loan, the value of
          the Program assets transferred in satisfaction of the loan shall
          not exceed the amount of the default and, if the lender is a
          Party in Interest or Disqualified Person, shall not exceed an
          amount of Plan assets equal to the amount of the payment schedule
          with respect to which there is a failure to pay; and

               (f)  The loan may provide that there shall be no required
          payments of principal and/or interest for one or more years and
          the Company may from time to time request the Trustee to
          renegotiate any such loan to change the payment terms with
          respect to payments not then due and payable, to extend the
          period of payment, or to reduce or eliminate the amount of any
          payment or payments of principal and/or interest not then due and
          payable.

          These rules shall be changed by amendment to the Program to the
     extent changes in applicable law require or permit.

         6.2   Accounting for Loan Proceeds and Leveraged ESOP
     Contributions.  The Committee shall establish with respect to each
     loan a separate Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account to record and
     separately account for:  (a) the proceeds of each loan or other
     extension of credit authorized under Section 6.1 and any unallocated
     Company Stock purchased with proceeds of such a loan or any loan
     refinanced with such loan (and any Company Stock into which such 
     purchased shares have been converted), (b) Leveraged ESOP
     Contributions with respect to such loan, (c) any income, gains or
     losses allocated to the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account with respect
     to such loan and (d) any dividends from shares of Company Stock
     purchased (and Company Stock into which such purchased shares have
     been converted) with the proceeds of the loan (or any loan refinanced
     with such loan) which have been allocated to Participants' Accounts
     and transferred to the Suspense Account.  Subject to the discretion of
     the Trustee to reinvest proceeds from the sale of Company Stock
     pursuant to Section 6.4(b), earnings of the Leveraged ESOP Suspense
     Account with respect to a loan shall be used to repay the loan, and to
     the extent not so used shall be released and allocated under
     Section 6.3 hereof.  Assets shall be released from the Leveraged ESOP
     Suspense Account only in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3
     or to repay a loan or for reinvestment in Company Stock pursuant to
     Section 6.4(b), provided, however, proceeds of an Exempt Loan may not
     be used to repay any loan which is not an Exempt Loan.

         6.3   Release from Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account.

               (a)  Loan Repayment Release.  Company Stock acquired with
          the proceeds of an Exempt Loan, or other loan authorized under
          Section 6.1 or a loan refinanced with such Exempt Loan or other
          loan (and Company Stock into which such purchased shares have
          been converted) and held in the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account
          under Section 6.2 shall be released as of the last Valuation Date
          of a Plan Year immediately following the release under
          Section 6.3(b) for such Valuation Date for allocation to 
          Leveraged ESOP Accounts, of each Active Participant in accordance
          with the provisions of Section 6.3(a)(1) below, unless such loan
          provides for the annual payment of principal and interest at a
          cumulative rate that is not less rapid at any time than level
          annual payments of such amounts for ten (10) years, and the
          interest paid on such loan is determined under standard loan
          amortization tables, in which case such Company Stock shall be
          released in accordance with Section 6.3(a)(1) or (2) below, as
          may be selected by the Board of Directors in its discretion at
          the time such loan is made; provided, however, if such loan is
          renewed, extended or refinanced, and if the sum of the expired
          duration of the loan, any renewal period, extension period, and
          the duration of the refinancing exceeds ten (10) years,
          determined as of the date of the renewal, extension or
          refinancing, Section 6.3(a)(1) shall apply:

                    (1)  Each Plan Year in which any amount remains
               outstanding under an Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized
               under Section 6.1), the number of shares of Company Stock
               released from the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account shall
               equal the difference between (A) the product (rounded upward
               to the nearest whole number of shares) of the number of
               shares of Company Stock held and accounted for under the
               Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account immediately before the
               release increased by the number of shares, if any,
               previously released from the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account
               in accordance with Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year with
               respect to such loan, multiplied by a fraction, the 
               numerator of which is the amount of principal and interest
               paid on the Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under
               Section 6.1) for the Plan Year and the denominator of which
               is the sum of the numerator plus the principal and interest
               to be paid for all future Plan Years (without consideration
               of possible extensions or renewal periods) reduced by
               (B) the number of shares, if any, previously released from
               the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account in accordance with
               Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year with respect to such loan.
               If the interest rate under the Exempt Loan (or other loan
               authorized under Section 6.1) is variable, the interest to
               be paid in future Plan Years shall be computed by using the
               interest rate applicable as of the end of the Plan Year of
               payment.

                    (2)  For each Plan Year during the duration of an
               Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1),
               the number of shares of Company Stock released from the
               Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account shall equal the difference
               between (A) the product of the number of shares of Company
               Stock held and accounted for under the Leveraged ESOP
               Suspense Account immediately before the release increased by
               the number of shares, if any, previously released from the
               Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account in accordance with
               Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year with respect to such loan,
               multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
               amount of principal paid on the Exempt Loan (or other loan
               authorized under Section 6.1) for the Plan Year and the
               denominator of which is the sum of the numerator plus the
               principal to be paid for all future years reduced by (B) the
               number of shares, if any, previously released from the
               Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account in accordance with Section
               6.3(b) for the Plan Year with respect to such loan.

               If subsection (1) is applicable and if no amount of
          principal and interest is paid with respect to a loan for the
          Plan Year, or if subsection (2) is applicable and no amount of
          principal is paid for the Plan Year, there shall be no release of
          shares of Company Stock from the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account
          maintained with respect to such loan for the Plan Year in
          accordance with Section 6.3(a).  If an Exempt Loan (or other loan
          authorized under Section 6.1) is repaid as a result of a
          refinancing by another Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized
          under Section 6.1), such repayment shall not be considered a
          repayment of principal under Sections 6.3(a)(1) and (2) and the
          release of shares shall be determined as provided in Section
          6.3(a)(1) and (2), by aggregating principal and interest on the
          loan and any refinancings of the loan.

               (b)  As of each Valuation Date, there shall be released from
          the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account maintained with respect to
          each Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1)
          Company Stock in an amount equal to (1) the number of shares
          which have a fair market value as of the Valuation Date equal to
          the amount of dividends paid to the Trust with respect to shares
          of Company Stock which were purchased with the proceeds of such 
          loan or any loan refinanced with such loan (and Company Stock
          into which such purchased shares have been converted) and which
          have been allocated to Participants' Accounts, which dividends
          shall be received by the Trust since the immediately preceding
          Valuation Date, credited to Participants' Accounts and
          immediately placed in the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account to be
          used to repay the loan, reduced by (2) the number of any shares
          contributed or the number of shares purchased with any cash
          contributed to the Trust as Special Dividend Replacement
          Contributions in accordance with Section 4.2(d) with respect to
          the loan.

               (c)  Any release from the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account
          provided for in Section 6.3(b) for each Valuation Date during a
          Plan Year (including the last Valuation Date for a Plan Year)
          shall be made prior to the release from the Leveraged ESOP
          Suspense Account provided for in Section 6.3(a).

         6.4   Installment Payments on Exempt Loan.

               (a)  Installment Payments.  The Trustee shall make payments
          on an Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1) in
          the amounts and at such times as such payments are due under the
          terms of such loan and such additional payments on such loan as
          the Trustee determines in its discretion, provided, however, such
          payments shall be made solely from the Leveraged ESOP Suspense
          Account, from amounts of Leveraged ESOP Contributions made in
          cash, from dividends with respect to shares of Company Stock
          purchased with a loan or a loan refinanced by such loan (or
          Company Stock into which such shares have been converted) which
          shares have been released from a Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account
          and allocated to Participants' Accounts and from dividends or
          other earnings with respect to the Leveraged ESOP Suspense
          Account maintained with respect to such loan.

               (b)  Sale of Company Stock Held in Leveraged ESOP Suspense
          Account.  In the event that any shares of Company Stock acquired
          with the proceeds of a loan or a loan refinanced with such loan
          (and Company Stock into which such purchased shares have been
          converted) and held in a Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account are sold
          prior to release from such Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account, the
          Trustee, in its sole discretion, may either (1) apply the
          proceeds of such sale, or any portion thereof, toward repayment
          of such loan or a loan refinanced with such loan or (2) reinvest
          the proceeds of such sale, or any portion thereof, in shares of
          Company Stock.  In exercising its discretion pursuant to Section
          6.4(a), the Trustee shall consider the long-term interests of
          both current and future Participants and Beneficiaries in
          providing benefits under the Program and Trust.

         6.5   Non-Terminable Rights and Protections.  Any of the
     provisions herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the following
     protections and rights are non-terminable, except to the extent
     required or permitted under applicable law, Treasury Regulations and
     Rulings of the Internal Revenue Service,  with respect to proceeds of 
     an Exempt Loan regardless of whether the Program continues to be
     maintained as a leveraged ESOP.

               (a)  Except as provided in this Section 6.5, or except as
          otherwise required by applicable law, no security acquired with
          the proceeds of an Exempt Loan may be subject to a put, call
          (other than a call with respect to Company Stock which is
          convertible preferred stock which provides for a reasonable
          opportunity for a conversion into common stock of the Company
          which is Company Stock after such call is exercised), or other
          option, or buy-sell or similar arrangement while held by and when
          distributed from the Program, whether or not the Program is then
          an ESOP.

               (b)  If any Company Stock acquired with the proceeds of an
          Exempt Loan (or other loan authorized under Section 6.1) or which
          is otherwise subject to this provision pursuant to Section
          11.2(k) is not readily tradeable on an established market, or
          thereafter ceases to be publicly traded and if and only if such
          Company Stock should ever be distributed from the Program, the
          distributee shall be given an option exercisable only by the
          distributee (or the distributee's donees or a person, including
          an estate of a distributee, to whom the security passes by reason
          of the Participant's death), to put the security to the Company
          for a 60 day period beginning on the date of distribution ("First
          Put Period") and for another 60 day period commencing on the
          first anniversary of the date of distribution ("Second Put
          Period").  If such security ceases to be readily tradeable on an
          established market (or becomes subject to a trading limitation)
          before the end of the Second Put Period, the Company shall notify
          the Participant in writing on or before the 10th day after the
          date the security ceases to be readily tradeable on an
          established market (or becomes subject to a trading limitation)
          that the security is subject to a put option to the Company for
          any portion of the First Put Period and the Second Put Period
          remaining after the date the security ceases to be readily
          tradeable on an established market, and such notice shall inform
          the distributees of the terms of the put option.  The Program
          shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the
          rights and obligations of the Company with respect to the put
          option at the time the put option is exercised.  A put option
          hereunder shall be exercised by the holder notifying the Company
          in writing that the put option is being exercised.  If during the
          First Put Period or the Second Put Period, a distributee is
          unable to exercise a put option because the Company is prohibited
          from honoring it under applicable Federal or State law
          ("Non-Exercise Period"), the put option shall be exercisable
          during an extended put period ("Extended Put Period").  The
          Extended Put Period shall commence on the 10th day after the
          Company can honor the put option and notice of this fact is given
          to the distributees entitled to an Extended Put Period and shall
          extend for a period equal to the number of days in the
          Non-Exercise Period but not more than 60 days.

               If the Non-Exercise Period was for more than 60 days, a
          second Extended Put Period shall occur commencing on the first 
          anniversary of the first Extended Put Period and shall extend for
          the lesser of (1) 60 days or (2) number of days in the
          Non-Exercise Period reduced by 60 days.

               A put option shall be exercisable at a price equal to the
          value of the security determined as of the most recent Valuation
          Date following the Participant's exercise of the put option. 
          Payment under a put option shall not be restricted by the
          provisions of a loan or other arrangement, including the
          Company's articles of incorporation, unless so required by State
          law.  If the distributee exercises a put option with respect to
          Company Stock received by the Participant as part of an
          installment distribution, the Company shall pay for such Company
          Stock not later than thirty days after the exercise of such
          option.  If the distributee exercises a put option with respect
          to Company Stock received as part of a distribution to the
          Participant within one taxable year of the balance to the credit
          of the Participant's vested Net Balance Account, the Company may
          pay for such Company Stock not later than the thirtieth day after
          the exercise of such option or may elect to pay for such Company
          Stock with deferred payments.  Payments for shares of Company
          Stock put to the Company may be deferred only if adequate
          security and a reasonable rate of interest are provided and if
          periodic payments are made in substantially equal installments
          (at least annually) beginning within 30 days after the date the
          put option is exercised and extending for no more than 5 years
          after the put option is exercised.

          The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall not be terminated or
     amended except to the extent required or permitted under applicable
     law, Treasury Regulations and Rulings of the Internal Revenue Service.

         6.6   Independent Appraisals Required.  All valuations of Company
     Stock which is not readily tradeable on an established securities
     market shall be made as of each Valuation Date by an independent
     appraiser meeting requirements similar to the requirements of the
     regulations prescribed under Section 170(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue
     Code.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                          ALLOCATIONS OF CONTRIBUTIONS

         7.1   Profit Sharing Contribution Allocation Formula.

               (a)  As of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year, the
          Profit Sharing Contributions made pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(1)
          and the net income gains and losses of the Profit Sharing Holding
          Fund as provided in Sections 10.13 and 10.14 shall be allocated
          to the Profit Sharing Fund Account of each Active Participant who
          is a staff or an executive employee or a store manager, in an
          amount equal to the product of (1) multiplied by (2) where:

                    (1)  is Profit Sharing Contributions made pursuant to
               Section 3.1(b)(1) for the Plan Year, and 

                    (2)  is a fraction the numerator of which is the Active
               Participant's Considered Compensation for the Plan Year and
               the denominator of which is the total Considered
               Compensation of all such Active Participants for such Plan
               Year.

               (b)  As of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year, the
          Profit Sharing Contributions made pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(2)
          and the net income gains and losses of the Profit Sharing Holding
          Fund as provided in Sections 10.13 and 10.14 shall be allocated
          to the Profit Sharing Account of each Active Participant who is a
          certified swing manager, a primary maintenance employee or crew
          or other store hourly employee in an amount equal to the product
          of (1) multiplied by (2) where:

                    (1)  is Profit Sharing Contributions made pursuant to
               Section 3.1(b)(2) for the Plan Year, and

                    (2)  is a fraction of the numerator of which is the
               Active Participant's Considered Compensation for the Plan
               Year and the denominator of which is the total Considered
               Compensation of all such Active Participants for such Plan
               Year.

               (c)  Allocations to the Profit Sharing Accounts of Active
          Participants shall be made as soon as reasonably possible after
          the end of a Plan Year after the Company has determined that its
          final contribution for the Plan Year has been made to the
          McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing Master Trust. 
          Employer Profit Sharing Contributions shall be held in the Profit
          Sharing Holding Fund until allocated to the Profit Sharing
          Account of each Active Participant.  If notwithstanding its
          earlier determination that the final contribution for a Plan Year
          has been made, additional Employer Profit Sharing Contributions
          are contributed for a Plan Year, such contributions shall be
          allocated no later than the last day of the next following Plan
          Year.  Effective the first day of the calendar month next
          following the date amounts are allocated pursuant to this
          Section 7.1, such amounts shall be invested in accordance with
          the investment elections applicable to each respective
          Participant's Profit Sharing Account as provided in
          Sections 10.7, 10.8 or 10.9. 

         7.2   Employer Matching Contributions, Additional Employer
     Contributions and Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions.

               (a)  Allocation of Employer Matching Contributions.  As of
          each Valuation Date, the Employer Matching Contributions and
          Forfeitures held in the McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund
          shall be allocated to the Employer Matching Contribution Account
          of each Active Participant in an equal percentage (not to exceed
          the Matching Percentage as defined in Section 4.1(a)) of each
          Participant's Participant Elected Matched Contributions
          (excluding Special Participant Elected Matched Contributions)
          made for the period since the immediately preceding Valuation
          Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount in the McDESOP
          and Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund as of the last Valuation Date of
          the Plan Year (even if such contributions for the Plan Year are
          made after such Valuation Date as provided in Section 10.15)
          after allocations are made pursuant to the preceding sentence,
          shall be allocated to Employer Matching Contribution Account of
          each Active Participant who is an Employee on such Valuation Date
          in an amount equal to such remaining amount multiplied by a
          fraction the numerator of which is the amount of Participant
          Elected Matched Contributions (excluding Special Participant
          Elected Matched Contributions) made on behalf of such Active
          Participant for the Plan Year and the denominator of which is the
          total amount of Participant Elected Matched Contributions
          (excluding Special Participant Elected Matched Contributions)
          made on behalf of all such Active Participants for the Plan Year.

               (b)  Allocation of Special Section 401(k) Employer
          Contributions.  Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions to
          the Trust for a Plan Year shall be allocated, as of the last
          Valuation Date of the Plan Year, in an equal amount to the
          Employer Matching Contribution Account of each designated Active
          Participant.  The designated Active Participants shall be the
          smallest group of Non-Highly Compensated Employees who made
          Participant Elected Contributions for the Plan Year and to whom
          the dollar amount of per individual Special Section 401(k)
          Employer Contributions could be allocated which would cause the
          Program to pass whichever of the following tests it would not
          otherwise pass:  the ADP test in Section 5.2(e), the ACP test in
          Section 4.1(c) or the multiple use test in Section 5.4.

               (c)  Allocation of Additional Employer Contributions.  As of
          the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year as the Board of
          Directors may direct, Additional Employer Contributions shall be
          allocated to the Employer Matching Contribution Account of each
          Active Participant in an amount equal to the amount of the
          Additional Employer Contributions for the Plan Year multiplied by
          a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar
          months during which the Participant was an Active Participant,
          and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of full
          calendar months during which all Active Participants were Active
          Participants.

         7.3   Leveraged ESOP Contributions.

               (a)  Leveraged ESOP Contributions.  Any shares of Company
          Stock purchased with the proceeds of a loan (or Company Stock
          into which such shares have been converted) designated by the
          Board of Directors to be repaid by Compensation Based Leveraged
          ESOP Contributions (or a loan refinanced by such loan) and
          released from the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Accounts maintained
          with respect to such loan, any income from such Leveraged ESOP
          Suspense Accounts released pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.3, and
          any Forfeitures from Leveraged ESOP Accounts for the Plan Year
          shall be allocated to each Active Participant's Leveraged ESOP
          Account:

                    (1)  as of each Valuation Date, in an amount, if any,
               with respect to each loan equal to the amount of dividends
               paid with respect to Company Stock (or Company Stock into
               which such shares have been converted) which was purchased
               with the proceeds of such a loan (or a loan refinanced by
               such loan) and which has been allocated to the Participant's
               Account, which dividends, since the immediately preceding
               Valuation Date, were credited to Participants' Accounts and
               immediately transferred to the Leveraged ESOP Suspense
               Account pursuant to Section 10.13(b) to be used to make
               payments on the loan; and

                    (2)  as of the last Valuation Date of each Plan Year,
               in an amount equal to the number of shares of Company Stock
               released from the Leveraged ESOP Contribution Suspense
               Account in accordance with Section 6.3(a) multiplied by a
               fraction the numerator of which is the Considered
               Compensation of the Active Participant and the denominator
               of which is the total of all Considered Compensation of all
               Active Participants.

               (b)  Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions.  Additional
          Leveraged ESOP Contributions for a Plan Year which were
          designated in accordance with Section 4.2(c) as Per Capita
          Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions (and any Forfeitures
          therefrom) shall be allocated as of the last Valuation Date of
          the Plan Year to the Additional Leveraged ESOP Account of each
          Active Participant in an amount equal to the total amount of Per
          Capita Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions (and any
          Forfeitures therefrom) for the Plan Year divided by the number of
          Active Participants.  Additional Leveraged ESOP Contributions for
          a Plan Year which were designated in accordance with
          Section 4.2(c) as Compensation Based Additional Leveraged ESOP
          Contributions (and any Forfeitures therefrom) shall be allocated
          as of the last Valuation Date of such Plan Year to the Additional
          Leveraged ESOP Account of each Active Participant in an amount
          equal to the total amount of Additional Leveraged ESOP
          Contributions (and any Forfeitures therefrom) multiplied by a
          fraction the numerator of which is the Considered Compensation of
          such Active Participant and the denominator of which is the total
          Considered Compensation of all Active Participants for the Plan 
          Year.  Per Capita Additional Employer Leveraged ESOP
          Contributions and Compensation Based Additional Employer
          Leveraged ESOP Contributions shall be separately accounted for in
          Participants' Additional Leveraged ESOP Accounts.

               (c)  Special Dividend Replacement Contributions.  Any
          Special Dividend Replacement Contributions made to the Program
          pursuant to Section 4.2(d) shall be credited to Participant's
          Accounts to replace dividends which pursuant to Section 6.3(b)
          are credited to the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account to be used to
          repay the Exempt Loan the proceeds of which purchased the shares
          of Company Stock with respect to which such dividends were paid.

         7.4   Participant Elected Contributions.  As of each Valuation
     Date, the Participant Elected Contributions in the McDESOP and
     Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund shall be credited to the Participant
     Elected Contribution Accounts of the Participants for whom such
     contributions were made.

         7.5   Timing of Allocations.  Amounts allocated to or transferred
     to Participants' Accounts as of a Valuation Date shall be credited to
     the Accounts as of such Valuation Date but after the adjustments are
     made for Trust income as provided in Sections 10.12, 10.13 and 10.14.
      Amounts contributed to the Program shall be credited as of the date
     of contribution to the following Accounts and Funds:  Profit Sharing

     procedures approved by the Committee to make Rollovers to the Program.
     If any Rollover includes property other than money, the Trustee may

         8.2   Limited Participation.  An Employee who is not eligible to
     participate in the Program solely by reason of failing to meet the
     eligibility requirements of Section 2.1 and who reasonably expects to
     become a Participant when such requirements are met, may be a
     Participant in the Program solely for the limited purpose of making a
     Rollover subject to the same conditions on such Rollovers as any other
     Participant.

         8.3   Withdrawal of Rollovers.  At the election of the
     Participant, amounts in his Rollover Account and Rollover Holding
     Account may be withdrawn as provided in Section 11.16.

                         BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION

         9.1   Limitations on Contributions.  Any of the provisions herein
     to the contrary notwithstanding, a Participant's Annual Additions (as
     defined in paragraph (a) below) for any Plan Year shall not exceed his
     Maximum Annual Additions (as defined in paragraph (b) below) for the
     Plan Year.  If a Participant's Annual Additions would but for the
     provisions of this Section 9.1, exceed his Maximum Annual Additions
     (the "Annual Excess"), the Participant's Annual Additions for the Plan
     Year shall be reduced under Section 9.1(d) by the amount necessary to
     eliminate such Annual Excess.  Rollovers shall not be included as part
     of a Participant's Annual Additions.

               (a)  "Annual Additions" of a Participant for a Plan Year
          means the sum of the following:

                    (1)  Employer Contributions allocated to his Profit
               Sharing Account for the Plan Year;

                    (2)  Participant Elected Contributions, Employer
               Matching Contributions, Additional Employer Contributions,
               Special Section 401(k) Contributions and any Forfeitures
               allocated therewith for the Plan Year allocated to the
               Participant;

                    (3)  any amount of Leveraged ESOP Annual Additions, as
               determined under Section 9.1(c), allocated to the
               Participant;

                    (4)  all other employer contributions and forfeitures
               (excluding Forfeitures allocated to the Participant's
               Leveraged ESOP Account) for such Plan Year allocated to the
               Participant's accounts for such Plan Year under the Program
               or any other Related Defined Contribution Plan not already
               included under Section 9.1(a)(1), 9.1(a)(2) or 9.1(a)(3);

                    (5)  the amount of nondeductible participant
               contributions under the Program or any Related Plan made by
               the Participant for the Plan Year; and

                    (6)  solely with respect to the limitation under
               Section 9.1(b)(2) contributions allocated to any individual
               medical account as provided in Code Section 415(l)(1).

               (b)  "Maximum Annual Additions" of a Participant for a Plan
          Year means the lesser of (1) or (2) below:

                    (1)  25% of the Participant's Considered Compensation,
               or 

                    (2)  $30,000, adjusted in subsequent years for cost of
               living adjustments determined in accordance with regulations
               prescribed by the Secretary of Treasury or his delegate
               pursuant to the provisions of Section 415(d) of the Internal
               Revenue Code.

               (c)  "Leveraged ESOP Annual Additions" means:

                    (1)  If the Participant is an Active Participant under
               the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Program, and if no more
               than one-third (1/3) of the total amounts deductible under
               Section 404(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code for the Plan
               Year is allocated to Highly Compensated Employees, an amount
               for each Exempt Loan equal to the product of (A) the
               Employer Leveraged ESOP Contributions used to repay each
               loan for the Plan Year, reduced, for any Plan Year for which
               the loan repaid is an Exempt Loan as defined in Section 6.1,
               by the amount used to pay interest on the Exempt Loan,
               multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
               Participant's Considered Compensation for the Plan Year, and
               the denominator of which is the Considered Compensation of
               all Active Participants for the Plan Year; provided that, if
               a Participant's allocations to his Leveraged ESOP Account
               are reduced in order to reduce the Annual Excess in
               accordance with the provisions of this Article IX, the
               Participant's Considered Compensation for purposes of both
               the numerator and the denominator of this fraction shall be
               reduced to an amount equal to the Ptiiccipant's Considered
               Compensation, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
               which is the Participant's allocation to his Leveraged ESOP
               Account for the Plan Year after applying the Annual Excess
               reduction provisions hereunder and the denominator of which
               is such allocation to his Leveraged ESOP Account for the
               Plan Year before applying the Annual Excess reduction
               provisions hereunder.

                    (2)  If the Participant is an Active Participant with
               respect to the ESOP for the Plan Year and if
               Section 9.1(c)(1) does not apply, an amount for each loan
               equal to the sum of (A) Forfeitures allocated to the
               Participant's Leveraged ESOP Account under the McDESOP
               portion of the Program, and (B) the sum of the products of
               the Leveraged ESOP Contributions used to repay each loan for
               the Plan Year (including the amount used to repay interest
               on such loans), multiplied by (i) in the case of Leveraged
               ESOP Contributions, a fraction, the numerator of which is
               the Participant's Considered Compensation for the Plan Year
               and the denominator of which is the Considered Compensation
               of all Active Participants for the Plan Year; provided that,
               if a Participant's allocations to his Leveraged ESOP Account
               are reduced in order to reduce the Annual Excess in
               accordance with the provisions of this Article IX, the
               Participant's Considered Compensation for purposes of both
               the numerator and the denominator of this fraction shall be
               reduced to an amount equal to the Participant's Considered 
               Compensation, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
               which is the Participant's allocation to his Leveraged ESOP
               Account for the Plan Year, after applying the Annual Excess
               reduction provisions hereunder and the denominator of which
               is such allocation to his Leveraged ESOP Account for the
               Plan Year before applying the Annual Excess reduction
               provisions hereunder.

                    (3)  The amount of Leveraged ESOP Contributions deemed
               to be used to pay interest on a loan for a Plan Year for
               purposes of Section 9.1(c)(2)(A) and (B) shall be the amount
               of Leveraged ESOP Contributions made for the Plan Year
               multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
               amount of all interest payments made by the Trust for the
               Plan Year with respect to such loan (including any
               refinancing of such loan) from all sources and the
               denominator of which is the amount of all payments of both
               principal and interest made by the Trust for the Plan Year
               with respect to such loan (including any refinancing of such
               loan) from all sources.

               (d)  Elimination of Annual Excess.  If a Participant has an
          Annual Excess for a Plan Year, such excess shall not be allocated
          to the Participant's Accounts, but shall be eliminated as
          follows:

                    (1)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's Employer
               Contributions allocable to such Participant's Profit Sharing
               Account shall be reduced to the extent such reductions
               reduce the Annual Excess.

                    (2)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's Leveraged ESOP
               Annual Additions (other than those with respect to Dividend
               Replacement Contributions) shall be reduced by reducing the
               allocations made as of a given Valuation Date reducing
               allocations with respect to Forfeitures before allocations
               with respect to Employer Contributions for each loan
               starting first with the most recent loan and then with other
               loans in the reverse of the order in which made to the
               extent which reductions reduce the amount of the Annual
               Excess.

                    (3)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, Participant Elected Contributions
               and Employer Matching Contributions shall be reduced by
               reducing those contributions most recently credited to the
               Participant's Accounts first (followed by the next most
               recent and so forth) and with respect to contributions
               credited as of a Valuation Date reducing contributions in
               the order listed, as follows:  Employer Matching
               Contributions, Participant Elected Unmatched Contributions
               and Participant Elected Matched Contributions to the extent
               such reductions reduce the amount of the Annual Excess. 

                    (4)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's allocations of
               Additional Employer Contributions shall be reduced to the
               extent such reductions reduce the amount of the Annual
               Excess.

                    (5)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's allocations of
               Special Section 401(k) Employer Contributions shall be
               reduced to the extent such reductions reduce the amount of
               the remaining Annual Excess.

                    (6)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, the Participant's allocations to
               his Additional Leveraged ESOP Account shall be reduced to
               the extent such reductions reduce the amount of the Annual
               Excess.

                    (7)  If any Annual Excess remains after application of
               the preceding paragraph, any Special Dividend Replacement
               Contributions credited to the Participant's Leveraged ESOP
               Account shall be reduced to the extent such reductions
               reduce the amount of the remaining Annual Excess.

          Any allocations of Employer Contributions and Forfeitures reduced
          or eliminated under this Section 9.1(d), as above provided,
          shall, subject to the limits of this Section 9.1, be reallocated
          to the Accounts of the other Participants not having such
          reductions as of the last day of that Plan Year in the same
          manner as such Employer Contributions and Forfeitures were
          initially allocated under Article VII.  The amount of any
          Participant Elected Contributions reduced or eliminated under
          this Section 9.1 which have been contributed to the Program shall
          be allocated as (and in lieu of) Employer Matching Contributions
          in the Plan Year for which or next following the Plan Year for
          which the reduction is made.  Any Employer Contributions and
          Forfeitures which, under the limits of this Section 9.1, cannot
          be reallocated to the Accounts of other Participants in the Plan
          Year shall, subject to the limits of this Section 9.1, be held in
          an unallocated suspense account and reallocated in a subsequent
          Plan Year.  If the Program shall be terminated, any amounts held
          in a suspense account shall be reallocated to the accounts of all
          Participants in accordance with Article VII subject to the
          limitations of Section 9.1anndd  any such amounts which cannot be
          reallocad  tto Participants in the Plan Year of the termination
          shall be returned to the Employers in such proportions as shall
          be determined by the Committee.

               (e)  Limitation in Case of Employee Participation in Both
          Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans.  If a Participant
          participates in any defined benefit plan of the Employer (or any
          Related Defined Benefit Plan), the sum of the Defined Benefit
          Plan Fraction (as defined in Section 415(e)(2) of the Internal
          Revenue Code) and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction (as
          defined in Section 415(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) for
          such Participant shall not exceed 1.0 (called the "Combined 
          Fraction").  If the Combined Fraction of such Participant exceeds
          1.0, the Participant's Defined Benefit Plan Fraction shall be
          reduced by limiting the Participant's annual benefits payable
          from the Related Defined Benefit Plan in which he participates to
          the extent necessary to reduce the Combined Fraction of such
          Participant to 1.0, and to the extent the Combined Fraction
          continues to exceed 1.0, by reducing the Participant's Maximum
          Annual Additions to the extent necessary to reduce the Combined
          Fraction to 1.0.  In calculating the Participant's Defined
          Contribution Fraction employee contributions as permitted under
          the Program or a Related Plan before January 1, 1987, shall be
          counted as Annual Additions only to the extent that they were
          counted under the Program as then in effect.

         9.2   Employer Contribution Reductions.  If a Participant's
     Participant Elected Contributions or his allocations of Employer
     Contributions and Forfeitures are reduced or eliminated under
     Section 9.1, the amount shall be provided to the Participant under
     McEqual, McCAP I or McCAP II, or other non-qualified plans maintained
     by the Company, to the extent therein provided.  Amounts of
     Participant Elected Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions
     expected to be within the limitations under Section 9.1 shall be
     contributed to the Program and credited hereunder.  Amounts of such
     contributions expected to be in excess of the limitations under
     Section 9.1 shall be tentatively credited to McEqual, McCAP I or
     McCAP II or other non-qualified plans maintained by the Company.  If
     it is subsequently determined that additional amounts of Participant
     Elected Contributions or Employer Matching Contributions should be
     contributed hereto to attain the limitations under Section 9.1, in
     order to put the Participant in the same position he would have been
     in had such amounts been contributed contemporaneously to the Program,
     contributions to the Program will reflect, to the extent of the limits
     of Section 9.1, the income, gains and losses which would have been
     credited to the Participant's Accounts hereunder had such amounts been
     credited hereto instead of being tentatively credited to McEqual,
     McCAP I, McCAP II or other non-qualified plans maintained by the
     Company.  The effect of adjustments to contributions for such income,
     gains and losses may be that some Participants hereunder will be
     credited with Participant Elected Contributions in excess of the
     limits stated in Sections 4.3(a) and 5.1 and in amounts which are more
     than or less than the amounts of such contributions elected by the
     Participant, and may have rates of Employer Matching Contributions
     which are larger or smaller than the rate established by the Company
     for the Plan Year in accordance with Section 4.1.  In determining the
     amounts to be credited to a Participant's accounts during a Plan Year
     under McEqual, McCAP I, McCAP II and other non-qualified plans maintained
     by the Company, the Committee may make assumptions based
     upon reasonable estimates of the amount of the Participant's
     Considered Compensation, his Participant Elected Contributions, levels
     of Employer Contributions hereunder and other relevant factors and, as
     necessary, make subsequent adjustments to the extent the estimates
     prove to be incorrect.

          shall be returned to the appropriate Employer within one year
          after the disallowance of the deduction; and

               (b)  if, and to the extent that, an Employer contribution is

          returned to the appropriate Employer within one year of the
          payment of the contribution and any Participant Elected
          Contributions shall be distributed to the Partipaannts with
          respect to which such contributions were made. 

          Notwithstanding any other provision of ts  SSection 10.5, if,
     upon application of (a) or (b) above, Employer contributions would be
     returned to an Employer, then the Employer shall distribute the value
     of any portion of such contributions to the appropriate Participants.

          All Employer Contributions are conditioned on their being
     deductible under Section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.

               stocks, and securities convertible into common stocks, of
               corporations other than McDonald's Corporation or its
               Domestic or Foreign Affiliates, and in any other securities
               which represent an equity investment, provided, however,
               that the Diversified Stock Fund may be invested in pooled or
               common trust funds or open-end investment companies without
               regard to whether assets of such funds or investment
               companies are invested in securities of McDonald's
               Corporation or its Domestic or Foreign Affiliates;

                    (2)  The Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund

               designated by the Committee which shall be invested (i) in
               contracts issued by an insurance or other company (or
               companies), (ii) directly in debt securities that have fixed
               obligations to pay interest and principal on specified dates
               or which have similar investment characteristics (which may
               have equity features triggered by performance, the passage
               of time, or similar characteristics or may be securities
               which are derivatives of such securities) ("Fixed Income

               regulated investment companies, or open-ended investment
               companies are invested in securities of McDonald's
               Corporation or its Domestic or Foreign Affiliates.  The
               contracts issued by insurance or other companies held by the
               Insurance Contract Fund (iv) may be investment contracts or
               (v) may be investment management agreements which may
               provide separate book value guarantees pursuant to which the
               insurance or other company guarantees (A) the book value of
               a pool or segregated group of fixed income obligations held
               in the Insurance Contract Fund and (B) specified amounts of
               income under various conditions as provided in such 
               agreement ((iv) and (v) collectively shall be referred to as

               Subject to Guarantee, the Program shall use book value
               accounting and Participants' Accounts shall contain and
               shall be entitled only to their pro rata share of book value
               and guaranteed income which for all purposes hereunder will
               be treated as fair market value unless the Committee
               determines that the guarantees no longer apply, a market
               value distribution has occurred under the contract, or there
               has been a default on the guarantee.

               estate, international common stocks, and securities

               equity investment, provided, however, that the Multi-Asset
               Fund may be invested in pooled or common trust funds or
               open-end investment companies without regard to whether
               assets of such funds or investment companies are invested in
               securities of McDonald's Corporation or its Domestic or
               Foreign Affiliates; and

               banks, in those banks designated under the McDonald's
               Corporation Investment Policy.

          Manager, the Trustee of the Trust is authorized to hold such

          common stock of McDonald's Corporation held in the McDESOP
          McDonald's Common Stock Fund, provided that it shall at all times
          be possible to determine the number of such shares of Company
          Stock which are allocated to a Participant's Leveraged ESOP
          Accounts.

               In order to maintain adequate liquidity, pending the
          investment of funds, or the use of funds to make payments on a
          loan, or for funds which could not be appropriately invested
          eher because of the small amount involved or the orrtt time
          duration for which the investment is to be made, the Trustee is
          authorized to hold portions of the Leveraged ESOP in cash, a STIF
          Fund or liquid short-term cash equivalent investments or
          securities (including, but not limited to United States
          government treasury bills, commercial paper, and savings accounts
          and certificates of deposit, including those of the Trustee or
          custodian, if the Trustee or custodian is a bank, and common or
          commingled trust funds invested in such securities, including
          those of the Trustee or custodian).

               Fund invested in Company Stock which is common stock of
               McDonald's Corporation.

                    (2)  McDESOP Diversification.  Participant Elected

               and 10.11 and (2) the compensation (from which such
               Participant Elected Contributions were taken) was paid or as

               case of future contributions subject to a Diversification
               Election pursuant to Section 10.10, the Diversification

          the Participant's share of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions
          multiplied by the Automatic McDonald's Stock Proportion.  The
          "Automatic McDonald's Stock Proportion" is a percentage, if any,
          announced by the Board of Directors for the Plan Year.  The
          remainder of the Participant's Employer Profit Sharing

          pursuant to Section 10.8, a percentage of his Employer Profit
          Sharing Contributions and the earnings thereon for the Plan Year
          greater than the Automatic McDonald's Stock Proportion would be
          invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund, the

          Proportion of his Employer Profit Sharing Contributions and
          Forfeitures with respect to the Profit Sharing Plan for the Plan
          Year invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund,
          his Employer Profit Sharing Contributions, such Forfeitures and

          immediately preceding investment election made with respect to
          such Accounts in accordance with Section 10.8; provided that any
          amounts invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock

          Stock Fund in accordance with Section 10.7 shall remain invested

                         the percentage of the Participant's Leveraged ESOP
                         Diversification Election shall be transferred to
                         Participant's Diversification Account.  No amount
                         transferred to a Participant's Diversification
                         Account may be transferred back to the
                         Participant's Leveraged ESOP Account.

                    (3)  Investment of Amounts Subject to Leveraged ESOP
              DDiversification Election.  The amount subject to a
               Participant's Leveraged ESOP Diversification Election shall
               be transferred to the Participant's Leveraged ESOP
               Diversification Account under the Program and thereafter
               shall be invested in accordance with the Participant's
               elections pursuant to Section 10.8 or 10.9(a) but determined
               without regard to Section 10.7 provided that such transfer
               shall occur no later than 90 days after the date on which
               the Participant becomes a Qualified Participant, attains age
               60 or the end of each Annual Election Period during which 
               the Participant makes a Leveraged ESOP Diversification
               Election or at such earlier dates as the Committee, pursuant
               to Section 10.11 shall permit.

               (b)  Diversification of McDESOP Future Participant Elected
          Contributions.  A Participant may make an election ("McDESOP
          Future Contribution Diversification Election") with respect to
          his future Participant Elected Contributions to have up to 100
          percent of the amount of such contributions, in increments of 5
          percent, credited to his McDESOP Diversification Account.  Once
          he has made a McDESOP Future Contribution Diversification
          Election, a Participant may change his election with respect to
          future Participant Elected Contributions, subject to
          Section 10.11, but each such change shall only effect Participant
          Elected Contributions made to the Program after the date the
          election is effective and before the date a new McDESOP Future
          Contribution Diversification Election becomes effective.

               (c)  Age Diversification of McDESOP Accounts.  Beginning
          with the first day of the month following the month in which a
          Participant attains 50 years of age, the Participant (or the
          Beneficiary of a Participant who would have attained age 50 if he
          had not died) may elect ("McDESOP Diversification Election") to
          diversify by transferring to his McDESOP Diversification Account
          up to 100 percent (100%) (in increments of five percent (5%)) of
          his:

                    (1)  Participant Elected Contribution Account; and

                    (2)  Employer Matching Contribution Accounts.

               The diversification amount to be transferred from a
          Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account shall be
          an amount equal to the difference between (A) the diversification
          percentage elected by the Participant multiplied by the sum of
          (i) the Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account,
          and (ii) the amounts previously transferred from the
          Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account to the
          Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account ("Prior Elected
          Contribution Transfers") reduced by (B) the amount of the
          Participant's Prior Elected Contribution Transfers.  The
          Diversification Amount to be transferred from a Participant's
          Employer Matching Contribution Accounts shall be an amount equal
          to the difference between (A) the diversification percentage
          elected by the Participant multiplied by the sum of (i) the
          Participant's Employer Matching Contribution Accounts and
          (ii) the amounts previously transferred from the Participant's
          Employer Matching Contribution Accounts to the Participant's
          McDESOP Diversification Account ("Prior Matching Contribution
          Transfers") reduced by (B) the amount of the Participant's Prior
          Matching Contribution Transfers.  If a Participant has made a
          Diversification Election and has not made a subsequent
          Diversification Election with a lower percentage, a percentage of
          the value of all future allocations to the Participant's
          Participant Elected Contribution Account and Employer Matching
          Contribution Accounts respectively equal to the percentage of the 
          Participant's Diversification Election shall be transferred to
          the Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account. 

               If a Participant who has made a McDESOP Diversification
          Election, makes a new McDESOP Diversification Election at a
          percentage (including zero) lower than the percentage of the
          earlier McDESOP Diversification Election, no portion of the
          allocations to the Participant's Participant Elected Contribution
          Account and Employer Matching Contribution Accounts,
          respectively, shall be transferred to the McDESOP Diversification
          Account until the respective products of the new lower percentage
          elected multiplied by (A) the sum of the Participant Elected
          Contribution Account plus Prior Elected Contribution Transfers
          and (B) the sum of the Employer Matching Contribution Accounts
          plus Prior Matching Contribution Transfers exceed (A) the Prior
          Elected Contribution Transfers and (B) Prior Matching
          Contribution Transfers, at which time each such respective
          excess, and thereafter, a percentage of all future allocations
          respectively to the Participant's Participant Elected
          Contribution Account and Employer Matching Contribution Accounts
          equal to the percentage of the Participant's McDESOP
          Diversification Election shall be transferred to the
          Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account.  A McDESOP
          Diversification Election shall be made at the same time and with
          the same effective dates and such other rules as investment
          elections under Section 10.11.  Once a Participant has made a
          McDESOP Diversification Election of a given percentage it will
          continue in effect until he makes a new election.  A Participant
          can elect to reduce the percentage of his McDESOP Diversification
          Election to a larger or a lesser percentage (including to zero);
          however, amounts already credited to his McDESOP Diversification
          Account shall not be transferred back to his Participant Elected
          Contribution Account and his Employer Matching Contribution
          Accounts.

               (d)  Distributions from Diversification Accounts.  The
          provisions of the Program shall apply to amounts subject to a
          Diversification Election under Section 10.10 in the same manner
          as to the Participant Elected Contribution Accounts or Employer
          Matching Contribution Accounts, except that the balance in a
          Participant's McDESOP Diversification Account shall be invested
          in the Trust Investment Funds in the same manner as the
          Participant elects to invest his Profit Sharing Account pursuant
          to Section 10.8 or as provided in Section 10.9(a), whichever is
          applicable, but determined without regard to Section 10.7. 
          Contributions credited to a Participant's McDESOP Contribution
          Diversification Account shall be credited to the Investment Funds
          available under the Profit Sharing Plan in the same proportions
          as the Participant elects pursuant to Section 10.8 or as provided
          in Section 10.9(a) whichever is applicable, but determined
          without regard to Section 10.7.  A Participant to whom a
          distribution is payable under Article X shall have the right to
          elect to receive any distributions made from his McDESOP
          Diversification Account in McDonald's common stock. 
             The foregoing provisions shall apply only to the extent that a
     Partipaannt does not receive distributions of amounts under Section
     11.13(b) during a Qualified Election Period.

        10.11  Effective Date of Participant's Investment and
     Diversification Elections.  Each Participant's investment election or
     Diversification Election submitted by the 25th of a calendar month,
     pursuant to Section 10.8 and a Diversification Election made pursuant
     to Section 10.10, shall be made effective as of the first day of the
     next calendar month or as soon thereafter as is administratively
     convenient.  Diversification Elections with respect to future
     contributions made in accordance with Section 10.10 shall be
     implemented the first day of the calendar month after the month in
     which such contributions are made to the Program or as soon thereafter
     as is administratively convenient.  This Section 10.11 is intended to
     give the Committee the authority to implement Participants' Investment
     Elections and Diversification Elections as soon as possible with due
     regard for requiring advance notice of elections.  The Committee may
     use such methods as making transfers between Investment Funds based
     upon estimates followed by corrective adjustments made when exact data
     becomes available and, in the event of inability to effectuate
     elections because of data processing, communications or other systems
     breakdowns, the Committee may effectuate such elections as soon as is
     reasonable under the existing circumstances.

        10.12  Trust Income.  As of the close of business on each Valuation
     Date, the Trustee shall determine the fair market value of the Trust
     Fund and of each separate Investment Fund.  The fair market value of
     Assets Subject to Guarantee, as defined in Section 10.6(a)(3), shall
     be book value for all purposes hereunder unless the Committee
     determines that the book value guarantees no longer apply, a market
     value distribution has occurred under the contract or there has been a
     default on the guarantee.  The fair market value of the Trust Fund and
     the Investment Funds shall be recorded and communicated in writing to
     the Committee by the Trustee.  The Trustee's determination of fair
     market value shall be final and conclusive on all persons.

        10.13  Adjustment of Participant Account Balances and Leveraged
     ESOP Suspense Accounts.  As of each Valuation Date, the Committee
     shall determine the adjustment required to be made to the value of
     each Participant's Accounts and the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Accounts
     to make the total of the portion of all such Account balances which
     are invested in an Investment Fund equal to the total value of that
     Investment Fund.
               (a)  Valuation of the Portion of Profit Sharing Accounts,
          Investment Savings Accounts, Rollover Accounts, Diversification
          Accounts, Participant Elected Contribution Accounts and Employer
          Matching Contribution Accounts invested in an Investment Fund. 
          The value of the portion of each of a Participant's Accounts
          invested in an Investment Fund as of a Valuation Date shall be
          equal to the product for each Investment Fund of (1) multiplied
          by (2) where:

                    (1)  is the value of an Investment Fund as of the
               Valuation Date, and 

                    (2)  is a fraction, the numerator of which is the value
               of the portion of each of a Participant's Accounts invested
               in such Investment Fund as of the Valuation Date reduced by
               any distributions therefrom on or since the immediately
               preceding Valuation Date and the denominator of which is the
               value of such Investment Fund as of the immediately
               preceding Valuation Date reduced by any distributions
               therefrom since the immediately preceding Valuation Date.

               (b)  Valuation of the Portion of the Leveraged ESOP Suspense
          Account and of Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts and Stock
          Sharing Accounts invested in Company Stock.  Each Valuation Date,
          Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts and Stock Sharing Accounts
          and the Leveraged ESOP Suspense Accounts shall be credited with
          the dividends and other distributions and earnings of shares of
          Company Stock credited thereto; provided that any dividends
          credited to Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts which are to be
          used to repay an Exempt Loan shall immediately after being so
          credited to Participants' Accounts be transferred to the
          Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account and held therein a separate
          account until used to repay a loan and further provided that the
          amount of such dividends transferred to the Leveraged ESOP
          Suspense Account for a Plan Year shall not exceed the fair market
          value of the Company Stock (determined on the Valuation Date
          allocated) allocated to Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts
          pursuant to Section 6.3(b) for the Plan Year.  Earnings on
          Forfeitures from the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Program shall
          be allocated to Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts as of each
          Valuation Date in the proportion that dividends and other
          distributions and earnings are allocated in accordance with the
          preceding sentence.  The income under Section 16.6 (d) shall be
          allocated to Participant's Stock Sharing Accounts in the
          proportion that each Participants Stock Sharing Account balance
          is to the total of all Participants' Stock Sharing Account
          balances.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the records of such
          accounts may be maintained in cash provided that it is at all
          times possible to determine the number and the basis of the
          shares Company Stock credited to a Participant's Accounts in the
          Leveraged ESOP and the Stock Sharing Plan and to the Leveraged
          ESOP Suspense Account.

          The Accounts of Participants as adjusted according to
     Section 10.13 shall determine the value of the interest of each
     Participant in the Trust for all purposes subject to the crediting of
     any contributions as provided in Article VII until a subsequent
     determination is made by the Committee. 

        10.14  Allocation of Income to Holding Funds. 

               (a)  Profit Sharing Holding Fund.  Any net income and gains
          (after reduction by losses and by expenses not paid by an
          Employer) of the Profit Sharing Holding Fund for a Plan Year
          shall be allocated to each Participant's Profit Sharing Accounts
          in the proportion that the amount of Profit Sharing Contributions
          allocated to each Participant in accordance with Section 7.1
          bears to the total amount of Profit Sharing Contributions
          allocated under Section 7.1 to all Participants.

               (b)  McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund.  Any net
          income and gains (after reduction by losses and by expenses not
          paid by an Employer) of the McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP Holding
          Fund for a Plan Year shall be allocated to Participants'
          Leveraged ESOP Accounts, Stock Sharing Accounts, and Participant
          Elected Contribution Accounts in the proportion that amounts
          identified with the McDESOP, Leveraged ESOP, and Stock Sharing
          portions of the Program are transferred to the McDESOP and
          Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund.  The amounts so allocated with
          respect to Participants' McDESOP Accounts shall be allocated to
          individual Participant's Participant Elected Contribution
          Accounts by addingucchhmoouunts to the numerator of the fraction
          described in Section 10.13(a)(2) as of the last Valuation Date of
          the Plan Year for the purpose of determining the value of such
          accounts.  The amounts allocated to Participants' Leveraged ESOP
          Accounts shall be added to earnings on Forfeitures from the
          Leveraged ESOP as of the last Valuation Date of the Plan Year and
          shall be allocated therewith in accordance with Section 10.13(b).
           The amounts allocated to the Stock Sharing Accounts shall be
          allocated in accordance with Section 10.13(b).

               (c)  Rollover Holding Fund.  Any net income and gains (after
          reduction by losses and by expenses not paid by an Employer) of
          the Rollover Holding Fund for a Plan Year shall be allocated to
          Participant's Profit Sharing Accounts pursuant to Section
          10.13(a).

        10.15  Separate Accounting in the Trust Fund.  The Committee shall
     create and maintain separate accounts for each Participant as
     described in Section 1.1.  Every adjustment to a Participant's
     Accounts shall be considered as having been made on the relevant
     Valuation Date, regardless of the date of actual entry or receipt by
     the Trustee of Employer Contributions and Participant Elected
     Contributions for a Plan Year.

        10.16  Trust Investment.  The assets of a Trust Fund may at any one
     time be invested up to 100% exclusively in Company Stock subject to
     the provisions of the Trust.

        10.17  Separate Accounting for Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account. 
     The Committee shall create and maintain a separate account, called an
     Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account, to record and to separately account
     for (a) each loan or other extension of credit made pursuant to
     Section 6.1, (b) all Leveraged ESOP Contributions to the Program to
     repay each such loan or extension of credit, (c) net income, gains or 
     losses charged to such Leveraged ESOP Contributions and Leveraged ESOP
     Suspense Account under Sections 10.13 and 10.6(b), and (d) all
     payments made on such loan or other extension of credit until such
     loan or other extension of credit is repaid, in accordance with
     Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.

        10.18  Correction of Error.  In the event of any error, including
     but not limited to an error in the adjustment of a Participant's
     Accounts or an error in including or excluding persons as
     Participants, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may correct such
     error by either crediting or charging the adjustment required, or such
     adjustment as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine to
     be equitable, to make such correction to or against Forfeitures or to
     or against income and expenses of the Trust for the Plan Year in which
     the correction is made, or if an Employer contributes an amount to
     correct any such error, from such amount.

          Corrections of Participant Elected Contributions and Employer
     Matching Contributions which an individual should have been permitted
     to make, but because of an error in Program administration was not
     permitted to make, shall be made as provided in the preceding sentence
     by crediting the individual's Participant Elected Contribution Account
     and Employer Matching Contribution Account respectively with (a)
     Participant Elected Contributions equal to the average percentage of
     compensation which was contributed for the preceding Plan Year as such
     contributions by highly compensated employees or non-highly
     compensated employees (whichever the individual is classified as) and
     (b) the amount of Employer Matching Contributions and Forfeitures
     which would have been credited to such individual's Employer Matching
     Contribution Account with respect to such Employer Matching
     Contributions.  After the preceding correction is made, the
     Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account and Employer
     Matching Contribution Account shall be credited with a rate of return
     which is equal to the rate of return the Participant's accounts would
     have received had the accounts been invested in the manner in which
     such accounts were invested at the time the Participant was first
     given the opportunity to make Participant Elected Contributions.

          Except as provided in this Section, the Accounts of other
     Participants shall not be readjusted on account of such error.

        10.19  Statement of Accounts.  As soon as practicable after the
     last day of each Plan Year, the Committee shall deliver to each
     Participant a statement of his Net Balance Account.

        10.20  Purchase or Sale of Company Stock.  The Trustee, on behalf
     of the Program, may (a) sell Company Stock to a Party in Interest or a
     Disqualified Person if such sale is for at least the fair market value
     of the Company Stock and (b) purchase Company Stock from a Party in
     Interest or a Disqualified Person, if such purchase is for no more
     than the fair market value of the Company Stock and (c) no commission
     is charged with respect to such sale or acquisition; provided that
     such sale or acquisition is for the price of the Company Stock
     prevailing on an established securities market, if the Company Stock
     is readily tradeable on such market and determined by an independent 
     appraiser, if the Company Stock is not readily tradeable on an
     established securities market.

        10.21  Shareholder Rights in Company Stock.  A fundamental purpose
     of the Program and the Trust is to obtain for the Company, its
     shareholders, Participants and future Participants the benefits
     resulting from Participants having the right to vote shares of Company
     Stock and to determine whether shares of Company Stock should be sold
     or retained in response to a public or private tender offer.  A key
     purpose of the Program is to encourage Participants to feel and to act
     like owners of the Company by assuring them the opportunity to share
     the economic benefit of ownership of Company Stock and the opportunity
     to direct the manner in which shares held by the Program are voted at
     all shareholder meetings and to determine whether shares of Company
     Stock should be sold or retained in response to a public or private
     tender offer.  The broad employee participation in the Program at all
     levels of the Company and limitations on maximum benefits to
     Participants who are officers, shareholders or highly compensated
     employees assure that such voting and decisions by Participants
     represent the overall knowledge and experience of a broad
     representative cross-section of employees of the Company.  It,
     therefore, is anticipated that the votes and other decisions of
     Participants will be fairly representative of both present and future
     Participants' interests.  Accordingly it has been concluded that
     Participants are best able to determine questions concerning voting
     and whether to sell or retain shares of Company Stock in a public or
     private tender offer with respect to shares allocated to their own
     accounts, as each person is uniquely able to determine his best
     interests based upon both his unique knowledge of his own situation
     and his unique knowledge of the Company.  Moreover, because the
     overall broad group of employees who are Participants is fairly
     representative of both present and future Participants' interests it
     is beevveed that such Participants as a group are uniquely able to
     determine the best interests of future Participans who benefit from
     future allocations of Company Stock under the Program.  Further, such
     participation in fundamental shareholder decisions by Participants is
     expected to result in increased commitment to the success of the
     Company further enhancing financial rewards of plan participation for
     such Participants, as well as enhancing shareholder and Company
     values.  In order to assure that each Participant will express his or
      her unrestrained best judgment concerning how these rights should be
     exercised independent of any considerations associated with such
     Participant's employment status with the Company, Participants
     exercise such rights through a method that assures the confidentiality
     of their votes and other decisions.

               (a)  Allocated Shares.  With respect to shares (and
          fractional shares) of Company Stock which have been allocated to
          Participants' Accounts (including shares held in the Profit
          Sharing McDonald's Stock Fund with respect to amounts credited to
          Participant's Profit Sharing Account and Diversification
          Accounts), each Participant or Beneficiary, as a named fiduciary,
          shall have the right to direct the Trustee as to the manner of
          voting and the exercise of all other rights which a shareholder
          of record has with respect to such shares (including, but not
          limited to, the right to sell or retain such shares in a public 
          or private tender offer).  In voting or exercising such other
          rights with respect to such shares the Participants and
          Beneficiaries shall consider their own individual long-term best
          interests in providing benefits under the Program and Trust
          rather than a short term gain.  In the event that a Participant
          shall fail to direct the Trustee as to the manner of voting of
          such shares of Company Stock allocated to the Participant's
          Accounts or as to the exercise of other rights in respect of such
          shares, the Trustee shall vote such shares or exercise such
          rights with respect to such shares in accordance with Section
          10.21(b).

               (b)  Unallocated Shares and Allocated Shares Not Directed. 
          With respect to shares (and fractional shares) of Company Stock
          which are either not allocated to Participants' Accounts or are
          allocated to the Accounts of Participants who fail (or whose
          Beneficiaries fail) to provide any direction pursuant to Section
          10.21(a), each Participant who is an Employee, as a named
          fiduciary, shall have the right to direct the Trustee as to the
          manner of voting the number of such shares (and fractional
          shares), and the exercise of all other rights which a shareholder
          of record has with respect to such shares (including, but not
          limited to, the right to sell or retain such shares in a public
          or private tender offer), as is equal to the product of (i) the
          sum of the number of unallocated shares and undirected shares
          multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
          number of shares (and fractional shares) of Company Stock which
          have been allocated to the Accounts of such Participant and the
          denominator of which is the total number of shares (and
          fractional shares) of Company Stock which have been allocated to
          the Accounts of all Participants who give directions to the
          Trustee pursuant to this Section 10.21(b).  In voting or
          exercising such other rights with respect to such shares such
          Participants shall consider the long term interests of both
          current and future Participants and Beneficiaries in providing
          benefits under the Program and Trust rather than a short term
          gain.

               (c)  Named Fiduciaries.  The Trustee shall notify each
          Participant and Beneficiary who is authorized pursuant to Section
          10.21(a) and (b) to direct the Trustee as to the manner of voting
          and the exercise of other shareholder rights with respect to
          shares (and fractional shares) of Company Stock that such
          Participant or Beneficiary is a named fiduciary, within the
          meaning of Section 402(a)(2) of ERISA, with respect to such
          shares (and fractional shares), and shall instruct each such
          Participant and Beneficiary that is exercising such authority to
          direct the Trustee, with respect to shares of Company Stock
          allocated to his Accounts, he should consider his own individual
          long-term best interests in providing benefits under the Program
          and, with respect to shares of Company Stock voted pursuant to
          Section 10.21(b), he should consider the long-term interests of
          both current and future Participants and Beneficiaries in
          providing benefits under the Program and Trust rather than a
          short term gain. 

               (d)  Confidentiality.  The Trustee shall solicit the
          directions of Participants and Beneficiaries in accordance with
          Section 10.21(a) or (b) and shall follow such directions by
          delivering aggregated votes to the Company or otherwise
          implementing such directions in any convenient manner which
          preserves the confidentiality of the votes or other directions of
          individual Participants or Beneficiaries.  Any designee of the
          Trustee who assists in the solicitation or tabulation of the
          directions of Participants or Beneficiaries shall certify that he
          will maintain the confidentiality of all directions given.

        10.22  Cash Distributions with Respect to Company Stock.  If there
     is a discrepancy between (1) the amount received by the Trust upon the
     sale of Company Stock or credited to a portion of the Trust upon the
     transfer of Company Stock from one portion of the Trust to another,
     for the purpose of making cash distributions to Participants or
     Beneficiaries and (2) the value of such Company Stock on the Valuation
     Date as of which such stock is valued for the purpose of determining
     the amount of the Participant's cash distributions, such discrepancy
     shall be credited to or charged against the Trust Income of the
     portion of the Trust Fund (i.e., accounts in the Profit Sharing

               the Participant attains the age of 70-1/2, but not later
               than his Required Beginning Date; provided that if the
               Participant completes one year of Eligibility Service

               further elections to receive distributions made pursuant to

               until he again has a Break in Service or Termination of
               Employment.

               (b)  Elections by Retired or Disabled Participants.  As
          permitted in Section 11.2(a)(1), with respect to a distribution
          on account of a Participant's Termination of Employment on or
          after his Vesting Retirement Date or on account of Disability, a
          Participant may elect separately with respect to the portion of
          his Net Balance Account held in the Profit Sharing, McDESOP
          leveraged ESOP, Stock Sharing, Rollover and Investment Savings
          portions of the Program, on such form as may be provided or
          approved by the Committee, the form of benefit and the date
          (including an immediate or a delayed date) of commencement of
          benefits.  The actual date of distribution shall be determined in
          accordance with the administrative procedures established by the
          Plan Administrator but shall be no earlier than the day following
          the Valuation Date which next follows the date the completed
          election form is submitted to the Plan Administrator.  To the
          extent that such a Participant is receiving a portion of his
          benefit in a form other than an annuity purchased from an
          insurance company, he may from time to time make or change his
          benefit elections to accelerate or to delay the date and the rate
          of distribution on such a form as may be provided or approved by
          the Committee, subject to such rules as the Committee shall
          specify and to the limits stated in Sections 11.2(d) and 11.2(e), 
          hereof.  In the absence of any election, a Participant who has a
          Termination of Employment on or after his Vesting Retirement Date
          or on account of Disability shall be deemed to have elected to
          receive the vested portion of his Net Balance Account in a single
          non-periodic payment paid within a reasonable time after the end
          of the calendar year in which he attains age 70-1/2, but not
          later than his Required Beginning Date.

               (c)  Types of Annuities.  If the Participant elects to
          receive his benefit in the form of an annuity contract as
          permitted under Section 11.2(a)(1), each Participant, subject to
          Sections 11.2(d) and 11.2(e) shall have the right to direct the
          Trustee to purchase an available nontransferable annuity contract

          spouse, the periodic benefit payable to the Participant's
          Beneficiary shall not be greater than the following percentage of
          the benefit paid to the Participant:

                    benefit upon death of the beneficiary whose life was
                    being used to determine the period over which benefits
                    are being paid; or

                         (C)  to provide cash refunds of Participant

                    (3)  Minimum Distribution Incidental Benefit
               Requirements.  If benefits are paid in installments,
               payments for the calendar year in which the Participant
               attains the age of 70-1/2 and in each calendar year
               thereafter shall equal at least the dollar value of the

               Valuation Date of the immediately preceding Plan Year
               divided by the following Applicable Divisor:

               If benefits are paid in the form of an annuity with a period
               certain feature, the number of years over which such period
               certain payments are made shall not exceed the lesser of
               (1) the Participant's or the Participant's and Beneficiary's
               joint and last survivor life expectancy as determined in
               Section 11.12(e) or (2) the number of years shown in the
               Applicable Divisor column above. 

               (e)  Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuities.

                    (1)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
               Section 11.2, in the case of a Participant who has elected
               pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(1) to receive one or more of his
               Accounts in a life annuity, such distribution shall be in
               the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity purchased
               by the Trust from an insurance company designated by the
               Participant which is authorized to do business in any state
               and which has an A plus rating by A.M. Best Company or a
               comparable rating by a comparable service which rates
               insurance companies, unless the Participant with his
               spouse's consent as provided in Section 11.10 elects to
               receive a different form of annuity or another form of
               benefit.  The term "Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity"
               means an immediate annuity payable, for a married
               Participant, to the Participant for life and, if the
               Participant's spouse survives the Participant, a survivor
               annuity payable to the spouse for life in an amount equal to
               50 percent (50%) of the annuity payable to the Participant
               and, for an unmarried Participant, a single life annuity
               payable to the Participant for life.  The amount of the
               benefits payable under a Qualified Joint and Survivor
               Annuity shall be the amount which can be purchased from an
               insurance company with the vested portion of the one or more
               of his Accounts which the Participant elects to receive in
               the form of a life annuity.

                    (2)  If a Participant who has elected to receive all or
               a portion of his vested Net Balance Account in the form of a
               life annuity dies before the annuity starting date, such
               portion of his vested Net Balance Account shall be paid to
               his surviving spouse in the form of a Qualified
               Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving
               spouse for life ("QPSA") unless either the Participant, with
               his spouse's consent in accordance with Section 11.10, has
               elected to waive the QPSA or the spouse elects pursuant to
               Section 11.3(a)(3) to waive the QPSA and to receive another
               form of benefit; provided that if the Trust has paid for an
               annuity to provide a life annuity benefit elected by the
               Participant and the Participant dies before his annuity
               starting date under the contract, the QPSA shall be provided
               by the annuity contract and the surviving spouse shall have
               no claim against the Trust with respect to the Accounts
               which he has elected to receive in the form of a life
               annuity.  Any portion of a Participant's vested Net Balance
               Account in excess of the value of a QPSA, if paid directly
               by the Program, or remaining after the payment of annuity
               premiums to an insurance company, if paid by an insurance
               company, shall be distributed to the Participant's
               Beneficiary as provided in Section 11.3.

                    (3)  A Participant who elects to receive benefits in
               the form of a life annuity and to whom benefits would be
               payable in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor 
               Annuity pursuant to this Section 11.2(e) shall have the
               right to waive a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (such
               waiver shall be consented to by the Participant's spouse in
               writing in accordance with Section 11.10) and the QPSA by
               delivering written notice to the Committee, at any time
               within the 90 day period prior to the annuity starting date,
               to receive all or a portion of such benefits in a different
               form of annuity or another form of benefit.  If a
               Participant elects to receive benefits in the form of a life
               annuity, the Committee shall within a reasonable period of
               time provide the Participant, by personal delivery or first
               class mail, with a written explanation of:

                         (A)  the terms and conditions of the Qualified
                    Joint and Survivor Annuity and the QPSA;

                         (B)  the Participant's right to make, and the
                    effect of, an election to waive the Qualified Joint and
                    Survivor Annuity and the QPSA;

                         (C)  the rights of the Participant's spouse to
                    consent to the Participant's election to waive the
                    Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the QPSA and
                    the effect of consenting to such waiver; and

                         (D)  the Participant's right to make, and the
                    effect of, a revocation of an election to waive the
                    Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the QPSA.

               Any election made by a Participant to receive a life annuity
          form of benefit pursuant to this Section 11.2(e) may be revoked
          by such Participant (with his spouse's consent) by delivering
          written notice to the Committee at any time prior to the
          Participant's annuity starting date and, once revoked, may be
          made again at any time by delivering written notice to the
          Committee prior to the Participant's annuity starting date.  If a
          Participant, who has elected a life annuity form of benefit and
          who has not waived (with his spouse's consent) the QPSA, dies
          before his annuity starting date, his surviving spouse may elect
          pursuant to (A) through (D) and Section 11.10 to waive the QPSA.

               (f)  Form of Profit Sharing Distributions.  If the method of
          distribution selected by a Participant includes either a
          nonperiodic payment or installment payments or a combination of
          nonperiodic payments and installments, the Participant may elect,
          on such form and in such manner as the Committee shall provide or
          permit, to receive the Profit Sharing Plan portion of his vested
          Net Balance Account distributed in cash or in shares of
          McDonald's common stock or in any combination of the two as
          elected by the Participant; provided however that, in the absence
          of an election to receive shares of McDonald's common stock, such
          distributions shall be made in cash and, further provided, that
          the portion of such distribution distributed in the form of
          shares of McDonald's common stock shall not, except as otherwise
          provided below, exceed the value (if any) of the Participant's
          interest in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund. 

               Until such time as a Participant's vested Net Balance
          Account has been distributed, transferred to a Holding Fund in
          accordance with Section 10.23 or forfeited in accordance with
          Section 11.4, any portion of the Participant's Net Balance
          Account remaining in the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
          Program shall continue to be invested in accordance with
          Section 10.7 and the Participant's (or his Beneficiary's)
          investment elections in accordance with Sections 10.8 and 10.9,
          as applicable.

               (g)  McDESOP Accounts.  If the sum of the portion of a
          Participant's vested balances in his Participant Elected
          Contribution Account, Employer Matching Contribution Account and
          McDESOP Diversification Account to the extent it is attributable
          to amounts diversified from his Participant Elected Contributions
          or Employer Matching Contribution Account and is invested in
          McDonald's common stock, consists of $1500 or more as of the
          Valuation Date immediately preceding a distribution, such amounts
          shall be distributed in the form of shares of McDonald's common
          stock, unless the Participant (or his Beneficiary) elects a
          distribution in cash.  If the sum of the portion of a
          Participant's vested balance in his Participant Elected
          Contribution Account, Employer Matching Contribution Account and
          his Diversification Account to the extent it is attributable to
          his Participant Elected Contributions or Employer Matching
          Contributions and is invested in McDonald's common stock is less
          than $1500 as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the
          distribution, such Accounts shall be distributed in cash, unless
          the Participant (or his Beneficiary) elects to receive a
          distribution in shares of McDonald's common stock. 

               (h)  Leveraged ESOP Accounts.  If the sum of the portion of
          a Participant's vested balance in his Leveraged ESOP Accounts and
          his Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account to the extent it is
          invested in McDonald's common stock consists of $1500 or more as
          of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date of
          distribution, such accounts shall be distributed in the form of
          shares of McDonald's common stock, unless the Participant (or his
          Beneficiary) elects a distribution in cash.  If the sum of the
          portion of a Participant's vested Net Balance Account in his
          Leveraged ESOP Account and his Leveraged ESOP Diversification
          Account to the extent it is attributable to his Employer
          Leveraged ESOP Contributions and is invested in McDonald's common
          stock has a value of less than $1500 as of the Valuation Date
          immediately preceding the distribution, such Accounts shall be
          distributed in cash, unless the Participant (or his Beneficiary)
          elects to receive a distribution in shares of McDonald's common
          stock.

               (i)  Stock Sharing Accounts.  If a distribution from a
          Participant's Stock Sharing Accounts has a value of $1500 or more
          as of the Valuation Date preceding the date of distribution, the
          distribution shall be in the form of shares of common stock of
          the Company unless the Participant or Beneficiary elects to
          receive payment in cash.  If the amount to be distributed from a 
          Participant's Stock Sharing Accounts has a value of less than
          $1500, the distribution shall be in the form of cash unless the
          Participant elects to receive payment in the form of shares of
          common stock of the Company.

               (j)  If any distribution in shares of McDonald's common
          stock described in this Section 11.2 would not be in whole
          shares, the value of any fractional share shall be distributed in
          cash.  A Participant or Beneficiary who is entitled to a
          distribution may elect to receive a cash distribution in lieu of
          McDonald's common stock or a McDonald's common stock distribution
          in lieu of cash by filing a written election with the Committee
          on forms approved by the Committee and in a manner prescribed by
          the Committee on or before the Valuation Date coincident with or
          next preceding the date of distribution.

               Until such time as a Participant's vested Net Balance
          Account has been distributed, transferred to a Holding Fund in
          accordance with Section 10.23, or forfeited in accordance with
          Section 11.4, (A) any portion of his Net Balance Account in his
          Diversification Account shall continue to be invested as provided
          in Section 10.10, and (B) any portion of his Net Balance Account
          remaining in the McDESOP, Leveraged ESOP or Stock Sharing
          portions of the Program shall continue to be invested in Company
          Stock and held therein.

               (k)  Put Option.  If any Company Stock distributed from a
          Participant's Participant Elected Contribution Account, Employer
          Matching Contribution Account, McDESOP Diversification Account,
          Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account or Stock Sharing Account
          is not readily tradeable on an established market when
          distributed, the distributee shall have the put option rights
          which are described in Section 6.5(b) with respect to such
          shares.

               (l)  Distributions After Rehire.  If a Participant who has
          had a Termination of Employment subsequently becomes an Employee,
          such Participant shall not be entitled to elect distributions
          until he again becomes eligible to receive distributions as
          provided in Section 11.2.

        11.3   Payment of Net Balance Account on Death of Participant.

               (a)  Form of Payment.  The Net Balance Account of a
          Participant who dies before having a Termination of Employment
          shall be fully vested.  The Net Balance Account of a Participant
          who dies after having a Termination of Employment for reasons
          other than a Termination of Employment on or after Vesting
          Retirement Date, death or Disability shall be vested as provided
          in Section 11.4(b).  If a Participant dies before his entire
          vested Net Balance Account has been paid from the Program, except
          to the extent otherwise provided in Section 11.2(e)(2) in cases
          in which the Participant has elected an annuity form of
          distribution, distributions shall be made as follows: 

                    (1)  If the Participant has a surviving spouse, the
               Trustee shall distribute the vested portion of the
               Participant's Net Balance Account to the Participant's
               surviving spouse as the Participant's Beneficiary in
               accordance with Section 11.3(a)(3) unless the Participant
               (with his spouse's consent in accordance with Section 11.10)
               has named another Beneficiary.

                    (2)  If the Participant does not have a surviving
               spouse or if the Participant (with his spouse's written
               consent in accordance with Section 11.10) has named another
               Beneficiary, the Trustee shall distribute the vested portion
               of the Participant's Net Balance Account in accordance with
               Section 11.3(a)(3) to the Beneficiary named by the
               Participant in accordance with Section 11.6.

                    (3)  The Participant's vested Net Balance Account shall
               be distributed within a reasonable time after the Valuation
               Date following the Participant's death or at such later date
               as the Beneficiary may elect under Section 11.3(b). 
               Distributions to the Participant's Beneficiary shall be in
               whichever of the following methods of payment the
               Beneficiary, by written notice to the Committee, shall elect
               unless the Participant has elected in a written notice
               delivered to the Committee not to permit such Beneficiary
               elections in which case the Participant shall elect the
               method of payment, from the following:

                         (A)  A single non-periodic payment;

                         (B)  Substantially equal installments, not less
                    frequently than annually, over a period certain,
                    directly from the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
                    Program; or

                         (C)  In the form of a nontransferable annuity
                    contract purchased from an insurance company designated
                    by the Beneficiary which is authorized to do business
                    in any state and which has an A plus rating by A.M.
                    Best Company or a comparable rating by a comparable
                    service which rates insurance companies payable to the
                    Beneficiary over his life.

               In the absence of any election by a Participant or a
          Beneficiary as to time and manner of payment, the Participant and
          the Beneficiary shall be deemed to have elected to receive the
          benefit in an immediate single sum payment.  Distributions shall
          be made to a Participant's Beneficiary in cash or in Company
          Stock under the conditions provided in Sections 11.2(f) and
          11.2(g).

               (b)  Beneficiary's Elections.  With respect to a
          distribution on account of a Participant's death, his
          Beneficiary, as designated pursuant to Section 11.6, may elect
          the form of benefit and the date of commencement of benefits,
          unless the Participant has elected not to permit such Beneficiary 
          elections.  If the Participant has not elected otherwise, the
          Beneficiary may also elect, with respect to benefits not being
          received in the form of an annuity, to accelerate or to delay the
          receipt of benefits.  Such elections shall be made in writing on
          a form provided or approved by the Committee and are subject to
          such rules as the Committee shall specify and to the limits
          stated in Sections 11.3(c), 11.3(d), 11.3(e) and 11.3(f), as
          applicable.  Once a Beneficiary has made benefit elections, he
          may in the same manner and subject to the same conditions, with
          respect to benefits not being received in the form of an annuity
          contract purchased from an insurance company, change the election
          at any time, and with respect to any election delay or accelerate
          the receipt of benefits from time to time. 

               (c)  Period of Distribution - Death After Distributions
          Commence.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Program
          and any elections made by the Participant or his Beneficiary,
          except an election made in accordance with Section 11.13(a), if a
          Participant dies on or after his Required Beginning Date but
          before his entire vested Net Balance Account has been
          distributed, and on or after the date upon which distribution of
          his vested Net Balance Account has commenced in installments over
          a period certain:

                    (1)  not in excess of the life expectancy of the
               Participant or the joint and last survivor life expectancy
               of the Participant and his Beneficiary and such life
               expectancy was not subject to redetermination under Section
               11.12(b), the balance of the Participant's vested Net
               Balance Account shall be distributed to his Beneficiary at
               least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in
               effect on the date of the Participant's death; or

                    (2)  not in excess of the life expectancy or life
               expectancies which are subject to periodic redetermination
               in accordance with Section 11.12(b), the balance of the
               Participant's vested Net Balance Account shall be
               distributed to his Beneficiary (A) by the last day of the
               Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant
               died, if the period was based solely upon the Participant's
               life expectancy and (B) over a period not longer than the
               Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy as determined under
               the method of determining life expectancy used for the
               Beneficiary at the time benefit payments commenced to the
               Participant, if the period was based upon the joint and last
               survivor life expectancy of the Participant and the
               Beneficiary.  The remaining life expectancy of a Beneficiary
               for purposes of the preceding sentence shall be (1) if such
               life expectancy is not subject to redetermination, the
               Beneficiary's life expectancy at the time installment
               payments commenced to be made to the Participant reduced by
               one year for each year over which such payments have been
               made or (2) if such life expectancy is subject to
               redetermination, the Beneficiary's life expectancy as
               redetermined at the applicable times following the
               Participant's death. 

               (d)  Period of Distribution - Death Before Distributions
          Commence.  Notwithstanding any elections made by a Participant or
          Beneficiary, if Section 11.3(c) is not applicable, and a
          Participant dies before his entire vested Net Balance Account has
          been distributed or commenced to be distributed, the
          Participant's vested Net Balance Account shall be distributed not
          later than December 31 of the calendar year which contains the
          fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; except that if his
          Beneficiary is an individual, the Participant's vested Net
          Balance Account may be distributed over a period not exceeding
          the Beneficiary's life expectancy (or, if there are multiple
          Beneficiaries, the Beneficiary with the shortest life expectancy)
          determined as of the date of the Participant's death, and if the
          Beneficiary is a trust, the Participant's vested Net Balance
          Account may be distributed over a period not exceeding the life
          expectancy, determined as of the Participant's death, of the
          beneficiary of the trust or estate who then has the shortest life
          expectancy, beginning no later than December 31 of the calendar
          year after the calendar year of the Participant's death to the
          extent permitted under Section 11.3(h).  Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, if the Beneficiary is the Participant's surviving
          spouse, distribution shall be made or shall commence not later
          than December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant
          would have attained the age of 70-1/2 years.

               (e)  Death of Surviving Spouse Who Is Beneficiary Before
          Benefit Payments Commence.  If the surviving spouse of a
          Participant is the Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies
          before distributions have begun to the surviving spouse in
          accordance with Section 11.3(c)(1) or (2), the rules of Sections
          11.3(c) and 11.3(d) shall apply as though such surviving spouse
          were the Participant, substituting the date of death of such
          spouse for the date of the Participant's death to determine the
          dates therein.  Distributions are considered to have begun to the
          surviving spouse on the later of the dates specified in Section
          11.3(c)(1) or (2).

               (f)  Death of Beneficiary After Benefit Payments Commence. 
          If a Beneficiary has commenced to receive distributions under
          Section 11.3(d), and such Beneficiary dies before the entire
          vested Net Balance Account has been distributed, any subsequent
          Beneficiary whose status as a Beneficiary was contingent on the
          death of the first Beneficiary shall receive distributions at
          least as rapidly as under the distribution method in effect upon
          the first Beneficiary's death.

               (g)  Amount Paid to a Child.  Any amount paid to a child, in
          accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the
          Treasury, shall be treated as if it had been paid to the
          Participant's surviving spouse if such amount will become payable
          to the surviving spouse upon such child reaching majority (or
          such other events as the Secretary of the Treasury may by
          regulations prescribe). 

               (h)  Trust as Beneficiary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
          provisions of Section 11.3, if a trust is designated the
          Beneficiary under the Program and

                    (1)  if the following requirements are met, the
               Beneficiary or Beneficiaries of the trust shall be
               considered the Beneficiary in accordance with applicable
               regulations and rulings for the purpose of determining the
               period over which distributions in the form of installments
               or annuities may be distributed.  The applicable trust
               requirements are:

                         (A)  the trust is a valid trust under state law,
                    or would be but for the fact that there is no corpus;

                         (B)  the trust is irrevocable, as of the
                    Participant's death;

                         (C)  the beneficiaries of the trust with respect
                    to the trust's interest in the Participant's vested Net
                    Balance Account are identifiable; and

                         (D)  a copy of the trust instrument is provided to
                    the Plan Administrator; and

                    (2)  If the above listed requirements are not met and
               the Participant dies on or after the Participant's Required
               Beginning Date, the Participant shall be treated as not
               having designated a Beneficiary for purposes of determining
               the period over which distributions may be made and
               distributions shall be made to the trust at least as rapidly
               as over the longest period over which distributions could
               have been made under Section 11.3(c) if the Participant had
               no Beneficiary.

                    (3)  If the above listed requirements are not met, and
               the Participant dies before his Required Beginning Date, the
               Participant shall be treated as not having designated a
               Beneficiary for purposes of the exception to the requirement
               in Section 11.3(d) that distributions be made within five
               years and distributions shall be made within the five year
               period designated in Section 11.3(d).

        11.4   Vesting and Forfeitures.

               (a)  A Participant who has a Termination of Employment on or
          after his Vesting Retirement Date or who has a Termination of

               (b)  If a Participant has a Break in Service or has a
          Termination of Employment with the Employer for reasons other
          than retirement on or after his Vesting Retirement Date, death,

          Contribution Account; (5) Employer Matching Contribution Account;

          Diversification Account in accordance with the following table
          wherein the first column represents the Credited Service of the
          Participant, and the second column represents the Vested
          Percentage of the Participant's Profit Sharing Account, Leveraged
          ESOP Account and Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account:

               Years of Credited Service     Vested Percentage
               -------------------------     -----------------

               less than 2 years                       0

               7 years and over                        100

               (c)  The portion of the Participant's Profit Sharing
          Account, Leveraged ESOP Account and Leveraged ESOP
          Diversification Account which is not vested as of his Termination
          of Employment or the occurrence of a Break in Service shall
          become a Forfeiture at the earlier of (1) the first day of the
          Plan Year immediately following the Plan Year in which the
          Participant has five consecutive Breaks in Service or (2) as of
          the Valuation Date immediately following the Valuation Date as of
          which the Vested Percentage of the Participant's Profit Sharing
          Account, Leveraged ESOP Account and Leveraged ESOP
          Diversification Account, respectively, are distributed.  Subject
          to Section 11.3(d) and 11.3(e), (A) Forfeitures occurring with
          respect to a Participant's Profit Sharing Account shall be
          credited to the McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund as of the
          Valuation Date following the date the amount of such Forfeiture
          is determined but not later than the sixth Valuation Date after
          the date as of which the amounts became a Forfeiture and (B) from
          Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts and Leveraged ESOP
          Diversification Account shall be allocated for the Plan Year
          among all Active Participants as provided in Section 7.3 for
          Forfeitures from Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts.  A
          Participant whose Vested Percentage is zero at the time of his
          Termination of Employment or Break in Service shall be deemed to
          have had a distribution of the Vested Percentage of his Profit
          Sharing Account, Leveraged ESOP Account and Leveraged ESOP
          Diversification Account as of the Valuation Date immediately
          following the date on which the Participant has a Termination of
          Employment or Break in Service. 

               (d)  If a Participant, (1) who had a Termination of
          Employment, resumes employment with an Employer before he has a
          Break in Service or, (2) who had a Termination of Employment or
          Break in Service occurring on or after January 1, 1985, earns one
          Year of Eligibility Service following the Break in Service (but
          before having five consecutive Breaks in Service), the amount of 
          the Participant's Profit Sharing Account, Leveraged ESOP Account
          and Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account, if any, forfeited
          under Section 11.4(c) shall be reinstated to the respective
          Accounts out of Forfeitures from the Profit Sharing portion and
          the leveraged ESOP portion of the McDESOP portion of the Program,
          respectively, for the Plan Year in which such resumption of
          employment occurs or such one Year of Eligibility Service is
          earned, whichever is applicable.  To the extent that Forfeitures
          for such Plan Year are not sufficient, the amount to be
          reinstated shall be charged against income of the Profit Sharing
          Holding Fund and the McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund,
          respectively.  Thereafter, in the case of a Participant who
          received a distribution and had his Forfeiture reinstated, the
          Participant's Vested Percentage in his Profit Sharing Account,
          Leveraged ESOP Account or Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account
          shall be equal to an amount determined by subtracting the amount
          distributed (the "Distributed Amount") on the Participant's
          Termination of Employment or Break in Service from the product of
          (1) the Participant's Vested Percentage determined pursuant to
          Section 11.4 multiplied by (2) the sum of (a) the Distributed
          Amount and (b) the value of the Participant's Profit Sharing
          Account, Leveraged ESOP Account or Leveraged ESOP Diversification
          Account, respectively.

               (e)  The amount, if any, forfeited under Section 11.4(c)
          shall not be reinstated if a Participant is rehired or again
          becomes a Participant and if the Participant (1) had a Break in
          Service before January 1, 1985 or (2) did not have a Break in
          Service before January 1, 1985 and had five consecutive Breaks in
          Service.  If all or a portion of the Vested Percentage of a
          Participant's Profit Sharing Account, Leveraged ESOP Account or
          Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account prior to his Termination
          of Employment or Break in Service was not distributed prior to
          his resumption of service and he was not 100% vested in such
          accounts upon Termination of Employment or Break in Service,
          then:  (1) the Vested Percentage of the Participant's Profit
          Sharing Account, Leveraged ESOP Account or Leveraged ESOP
          Diversification Account at the time of Forfeiture which was not
          distributed shall be held in a "Pre-Break Profit Sharing
          Account," "Pre-Break Leveraged ESOP Account" or "Pre-Break
          Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account," respectively, which
          shall be 100% vested; and (2) the Participant's Profit Sharing
          Contributions and the net earnings thereon and Leveraged ESOP
          Contributions and the net earnings thereon attributable to
          service after the Break in Service or five (5) consecutive Breaks
          in Service, as applicable, shall be held in a "Post-Break Profit
          Sharing Account," and "Post-Break Leveraged ESOP Account,"
          respectively, which shall be vested in accordance with Section
          11.4(b).  Any amounts transferred to the Participant's Leveraged
          ESOP Diversification Account from the Participant's Pre-Break
          Leveraged ESOP Account shall be held in the Participant's
          Pre-Break Leveraged ESOP Diversification Account and amounts
          transferred from the Participant's Post-Break Leveraged ESOP
          Account shall be held in the Participant's Post-Break Leveraged
          ESOP Diversification Account. 

               (f)  Each Participant who is a certified swing manager,
          primary maintenance employee, crew member or other hourly
          restaurant employee who is an Employee on July 1, 1992, shall be
          fully vested in his Leveraged ESOP Account as of July 1, 1992.

        11.5   Payment of Employer Profit Sharing Contribution for Year of
     Termination of Employment.  If a Participant (or the Beneficiary
     thereof) who is an Active Participant for the Plan Year in which or
     immediately before which he has a Termination of Employment receives
     an allocation of Employer Profit Sharing Contributions pursuant to
     Section 7.1, an allocation of Company Stock released from the
     Leveraged ESOP Suspense Account pursuant to Section 7.3 or an
     allocation of Employer Matching Contributions and Forfeitures pursuant
     to Section 7.2 after he has received a single sum distribution of his
     Net Balance Account, the vested portion of any such allocation shall
     be distributed to the Participant or, in the event of his death, to
     his Beneficiary within a reasonable time after the later of the close
     of the Plan Year or the Valuation Date following the Participant's
     election to receive such distribution.  If such Participant or
     Beneficiary has not received a single sum distribution of his vested
     Net Balance Account, any such allocations pursuant to Sections 7.1,
     7.2 and 7.3 for the Plan Year shall be credited to the Participant's
     respective Accounts and the vested portion of such contributions shall
     be distributed as a part of such account in the manner provided in
     Section 11.2 or 11.3, whichever shall apply.

        11.6   Designation of Beneficiary and Form of Beneficiary Benefit.
      Subject to Sections 11.3 and 11.10, the Participant may (1) designate
     his Beneficiary, (2) elect the form of his Beneficiary's benefit and
     (3) elect to prohibit Beneficiary elections under Section 11.3(b) on
     forms provided by and filed with the Committee; provided that a
     beneficiary designation completed and filed with the Committee before
     January 1, 1989, under the McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit
     Sharing Plan shall be deemed to apply to the Profit Sharing Plan
     portion of the Program and a beneficiary designation completed and
     filed with the Committee before January 1, 1989, under the McDonald's
     Matching and Deferred Stock Ownership Plan shall be deemed to apply to
     the McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP portions of the Program.  A beneficiary
     designation form filed with the Committee on or after January 1, 1989
     and before January 1, 1996 shall be deemed to apply to the Profit
     Sharing, McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP portions of the Program and to
     replace all prior Beneficiary designations unless the Beneficiary
     designation provides otherwise.  A Beneficiary designation filed by a
     Participant under the Stock Sharing Plan before January 1, 1996 shall
     be deemed to apply to the Stock Sharing portion of the Program.  A
     Beneficiary designation filed with the Committee on or after January
     1, 1996, shall be deemed to apply to the entire Program and to replace
     all prior Beneficiary designations except to the extent such
     Beneficiary designation provides otherwise.  The Participant may
     submit separate Beneficiary designations for the Profit Sharing,
     McDESOP, Leveraged ESOP and Stock Sharing portions of the Program
     change his Beneficiary designation and his elections concerning his
     Beneficiary's benefit from time to time by filing the beneficiary
     designation form with the Committee.  No designation of Beneficiary or
     election concerning a Beneficiary's benefit or change of such
     designation or election shall be effective until filed with the 
     Committee.  If a Participant shall fail to file a valid Beneficiary
     designation, if all persons designated on the Beneficiary designation
     form predecease the Participant (or, in the case of a Beneficiary
     other than an individual, cease to exist prior to the Participant's
     death) or to the extent that the Participant's Beneficiary designation
     form fails to dispose of his entire interest, the Trustee shall
     distribute the Participant's vested Net Balance Account to the
     following persons in the following order of precedence:

               (a)  His surviving spouse;

               (b)  With respect to the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
          Program, his Beneficiary designated under McDESOP portion of the
          Program; with respect to the McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP portion
          of the Program, his Beneficiary designated under the McDonald's
          Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing Plan or the Profit Sharing
          Plan portion of the Program; and with respect to the Stock
          Sharing portion of the Program, those persons designated by the
          Participant to receive his death benefits under the Participant's
          Group Life Insurance Program of the Employer or, in the absence
          of such designation, under the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
          Program.

               (c)  The person or entity who receives the Participant's
          McDonald's group term life insurance benefits;

               (d)  His lawful descendants including adopted children per
          stripes;

               (e)  His parents in equal shares, or (if only one parent
          survives him) his surviving parent;

               (f)  The lawful descendants of his parents, per stripes;

               (g)  His estate.

     In the absence of a Participant's election to prohibit the Beneficiary
     elections allowed in Section 11.3(b), his Beneficiary shall be
     permitted to make such elections.

        11.7   Incompetency, Distribution of Benefits.

               (a)  If a Participant or Beneficiary is declared an
          incompetent or is a minor, and a conservator, guardian or other
          person legally charged with his care is appointed or if such
          Participant is not a minor and has executed a so-called durable
          power of attorney and if the Committee is given written notice of
          such appointment or power of attorney, any benefits to which such
          Participant or Beneficiary is entitled shall be distributable to
          such conservator, guardian or other person legally charged with
          his care or to the attorney-in-fact under the power of attorney.

               (b)  If a Participant or Beneficiary is incompetent, a minor
          or, in the opinion of the Committee, would fail to derive benefit
          from distribution of his accounts and if a conservator, guardian
          or other person legally charged with his care has not been 
          appointed or if the Committee has not been given written notice
          of such appointment, the Committee may (1) require the
          appointment of a conservator or guardian, (2) distribute the
          Participant's Accounts to relatives of the Participant or
          Beneficiary for the benefit of the Participant or Beneficiary, or
          (3) distribute such Accounts directly to or for the benefit of
          the Participant or Beneficiary.

               (c)  The decision of the Committee in such matters shall be
          final, binding and conclusive upon the Employer and the Trustee
          and upon each Employee, Participant, Beneficiary and every other
          person or party interested or concerned, and neither the
          Employer, the Committee nor the Trustee shall be under any duty
          to see to the proper application of such distribution made to or
          for a Participant or Beneficiary, or conservator, guardian or
          relative of a Participant or Beneficiary.

        11.8   Deduction of Taxes from Accounts Payable.  The Trustee or
     the Committee may deduct from the amount to be distributed such amount
     as the Trustee or the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems proper
     to protect the Trustee, the Committee and the Trust against liability
     for the payment of death, succession, inheritance, income, or other
     taxes, and out of the money so deducted, the Trustee may discharge any
     such liability and pay the amount remaining to the Participant, the
     Beneficiary or the deceased Participant's estate, as the case may be.

        11.9   Deadline for Payment of Benefits.  Except to the extent that
     a Participant in accordance with the Program otherwise elects and
     except to the extent it is not administratively feasible, payment of
     benefits shall be made or commence not later than sixty (60) days
     after the latest of (a) the close of the Plan Year in which the
     Participant attains age fifty-five (55), (b) the close of the Plan
     Year in which occurs the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Plan Year in
     which the Participant commenced participation, and (c) the close of
     the Plan Year in which the Participant has a Termination of
     Employment; provided that, a Participant, who is entitled to receive a
     distribution pursuant to this Section 11.9, must submit a claim for
     benefits before any distributions will be made hereunder.

        11.10  Spousal Consent to a Beneficiary or a Waiver.

               (a)  A valid spousal consent to the Participant's naming of
          a Beneficiary other than his spouse or to the Participant's
          Waiver of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualified
          Preretirement Survivor Annuity shall be:

                    (1)  in a writing acknowledging the effect of the
               consent;

                    (2)  witnessed by a notary public;

                    (3)  effective only with respect to a specific
               Beneficiary and, in the case of a waiver of a Qualified
               Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualified Preretirement
               Survivor Annuity, shall specify an optional form of benefit
               unless the spouse voluntarily in such consent expressly 
               permits subsequent designations of beneficiaries or
               elections of optional forms of benefit without further
               spousal consent and acknowledges the spouse's right to limit
               the consent to a specific Beneficiary and optional form of
               benefit, where applicable; and

                    (4)  effective only for the spouse who exercises the
               consent;

          provided that notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XI,
          the consent of a Participant's spouse shall not be required if it
          is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that
          such consent may not be obtained because there is no spouse,
          because the spouse cannot be located or because of such other
          circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations
          prescribe.

               (b)  To the extent provided in any Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order (as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal
          Revenue Code), the former spouse of a Participant shall be
          treated as the surviving spouse of such Participant for purposes
          of Section 11.3 and for providing consent in accordance with
          Section 11.10(a).

        11.11  Single Sum Payment without Election.  Notwithstanding any
     provisions of this Article XI (except Section 11.14 to the extent
     therein provided) to the contrary, if the Participant or Beneficiary
     is entitled to a distribution because of the Participant's Break in
     Service (but not in the case of a Break in Service without a
     Termination of Employment), retirement on or after his Vesting
     Retirement Date, death, Disability, or other Termination of
     Employment, and if the value of the vested portion of a Participant's
     Net Balance Account under the Program does not exceed $3,500, the
     Committee shall direct the immediate distribution of such benefit
     prior to the annuity starting date or other date of distribution or
     commencement of distribution, regardless of any election or consent of
     the Participant, his spouse, or other Beneficiary.  If the Net Balance
     Account under the Program of an alternate payee under a Qualified
     Domestic Relations Order, as provided under Section 16.5, does not
     exceed $3,500, the Committee shall direct the immediate distribution
     of such benefit regardless of any election of the alternate payee
     absent a contrary provision in the Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

        11.12  Installment Payments.  Notwithstanding anything in
     Sections 11.2 or 11.3 to the contrary and subject to Section 11.4:

               (a)  Elected Installments Paid to Participant.  If a
          Participant elects installment payments, they shall be
          substantially equal installments, paid at least annually, over a
          period certain as elected by the Participant which period shall
          not be in excess of the life expectancy of the Participant or the
          joint and last survivor life expectancy of the Participant and
          his Beneficiary, if such Beneficiary is an individual
          ("Applicable Life Expectancy") determined as of the date such
          payments commence; provided that if elected by the Participant 
          pursuant to Section 11.12(e), life expectancy may be
          redetermined.

               (b)  Required Installments Paid to Participant.  The
          Applicable Life Expectancy of a Participant, who according to the
          records of the Employer has attained the age of 70-1/2 and who
          elects to receive installments but who fails to make a
          permissible election with respect to the period over which
          installments shall be paid or fails to provide the Committee with
          any requested proof of his age or the age of his Beneficiary by
          such deadline as the Committee shall require, shall be deemed to
          be the life expectancy of the Participant as reasonably
          determined from the records of the Employer; provided that if a
          Participant subsequently provides the Committee with proof that
          his age is greater than the Employer's records indicated, the
          Committee shall redetermine the Participant's Applicable Life
          Expectancy based upon the corrected information and shall
          distribute to the Participant any amounts which would have been
          required to be distributed if the Participant's correct age had
          been used to determine his Applicable Life expectancy for the
          purpose of determining the Minimum Distribution Amount for any
          installment distributions which have already been made. 

               (c)  Installments Commencing After Participant's Death.  If
          installments commence to be paid after the Participant's death to
          the Participant's Beneficiary who is an individual, they shall be
          substantially equal installments, paid at least annually, over a
          period certain not in excess of the life expectancy of such
          individual ("Applicable Life Expectancy") determined as of the
          date such payments commence; provided that if the Participant's
          Beneficiary is his surviving spouse, such Beneficiary may elect
          to have his life expectancy redetermined as provided in
          Section 11.12(e).

               (d)  Minimum Distribution Amount.  Installment payments are
          substantially equal if the amount of each installment distributed
          in a calendar year is not less than an amount ("Minimum
          Distribution Amount") equal to the balance of the person's Net
          Balance Account as of the last day of the preceding calendar year
          divided by the Applicable Life Expectancy.  In calculating the
          Minimum Distribution Amount for each calendar year after the
          calendar year in which the Participant attained the age of 70-1/2
          or for each calendar year after payments to the Beneficiary have
          commenced (either of which is called the "First Year"), the
          Applicable Life Expectancy shall be reduced by one for each
          calendar year which has elapsed commencing with the First Year.

               (e)  Determination of Life Expectancy.  The life expectancy
          of a Participant and of his spouse and the joint and last
          survivor life expectancy of the Participant and his spouse may be
          redetermined for purposes of determining the amounts required to
          be distributed pursuant to Section 11.2(c), 11.2(d) or 11.12(a),
          if elected by the Participant (or his spouse, if the Participant
          is deceased and if his spouse is the Participant's Beneficiary)
          in accordance with such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as
          the Committee shall establish, but may not be redetermined more 
          frequently than annually.  Life expectancies shall not be
          redetermined unless the Participant (or spouse) so elects by the
          date distributions are required to commence under the Program. 
          Unless subject to redetermination, life expectancies are
          calculated using the Participant's or Beneficiary's birth date in
          the calendar year in which the Participant attains the age of
          70-1/2, in the case of benefits commencing during the
          Participant's lifetime and in the case of payments to the
          Beneficiary, as of the date such payments commence.  In the case
          of annuity payments, however, life expectancy is determined in
          the calendar year in which annuity payments commence.  If a
          Participant's or his spouse's life expectancy is not being
          redetermined, it shall be reduced by one for each year after the
          calendar year in which it was determined for the purpose of
          determining the amount of installment payments hereunder.  All
          life expectancies shall be determined using the expected return
          multiples in Tables V and VI of Treas. Reg. SubSection 1.72-6 or
          any successor tables issued from time to time by the Internal
          Revenue Service.

        11.13  Required Minimum Distributions to Employed Participants.

               (a)  A Participant who has attained his Required Beginning
          Date but has not had a Termination of Employment shall commence
          receiving installment payments for the calendar year in which he
          becomes 70-1/2 not later than April 1 of the following year and
          installment payments for each calendar year after the calendar
          year in which he became 70-1/2, not later than the last day of
          each such year.

               (b)  The amount distributed for the year in which such
          Participant becomes 70-1/2 and in each calendar year thereafter
          shall be not less than the Minimum Distribution Amount determined
          under Section 11.12(a).

               (c)  A Participant who has not had a Termination of
          Employment and who expects to attain his Required Beginning Date
          in the next calendar year, may elect at such time and on such
          form as the Committee shall permit to receive his first
          distribution required pursuant to Section 11.13(a) in the year in
          which he becomes 70-1/2 years of age.

               (d)  If the vested Net Balance Account of a Participant who
          receives a distribution of the Minimum Distribution Amount under
          this Section 11.13 is $3500 or less, the Participant may elect to
          receive his entire vested Net Balance Account at the same time
          that such Minimum Distribution Amount is paid.  A Participant,
          who elects to receive his entire vested Net Balance Account
          pursuant to the preceding sentence, may elect to have such
          election apply each subsequent Plan Year until he changes the
          election with respect to a future Plan Year.  Effective
          November 1, 1994, the first sentence of this Section 11.13(d)
          shall be applied without regard to the requirement that the
          Participant's vested Net Balance Account be $3,500 or less. 

        11.14  Transitional Rules.

               (a)  TEFRA 242(b) Elections.  Effective for all Participants
          and Beneficiaries whether or not the Participant was an Employee
          after the Effective Date of the Program, notwithstanding any
          other provision herein, distributions to Participants or
          Beneficiaries made from the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the
          Program, except for the Participant's Diversification Account,
          are subject to any valid election under TEFRA Section 242(b) made
          under the McDonald's Corporation Savings and Profit Sharing Plan
          by a Participant prior to January 1, 1984 to have the
          distribution of the Participant's benefits deferred or extended
          beyond the period otherwise permitted under the provisions of
          this Article XI which was then permitted under applicable law
          until the Participant (or his Beneficiary) revokes the election
          by an act recognized as a revocation under TEFRA 242(b); provided
          that if the Participant's spouse is not the Beneficiary of 100
          percent of his vested Accrued Benefit under the Program, the
          Participant's spouse shall have consented to the naming of
          another Beneficiary in accordance with Section 11.10.

               (b)  Distributions to Certain Participants and Beneficiaries
          in Pay Status.  Effective for all Participants and Beneficiaries
          whether or not the Participant was an Employee after January 1,
          1984, for any distribution which would not have disqualified the
          Trust under Code Section 401(a)(9) as in effect prior to
          amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, which was permitted
          under the Program as in effect on the date such distributions
          commenced, and which either

                    (1)  commenced prior to and continued on or after
               January 1, 1984, distributions may continue to the
               Participant or the Beneficiary to whom such distribution is
               being made under the method of distribution in effect;
               provided that the method of distribution was specified in a
               writing including the time at which the distribution was to
               commence, the period over which such distributions will be
               made and, in the case of any distribution upon the
               Participant's death, a list of the Beneficiaries of the
               Participant in order or priority; or

                    (2)  commenced prior to the first Plan Year beginning
               in 1985, distributions may continue to the Participant or
               the Beneficiary to the extent permitted under applicable
               law, regulations and rulings.

        11.15  Sale of Restaurant - Special Vesting Rules.  Notwithstanding
     any of the provisions herein to the contrary, a Participant who is not
     100% vested in his Profit Sharing Account and his Leveraged ESOP
     Account and who has a Termination of Employment on account of a sale
     on or after December 1, 1986 but prior to January 1, 1993 of a
     McDonald's restaurant to a joint venture partnership in which the
     Company owns an interest ("Joint Venture") shall have a single
     opportunity to elect, in accordance with such procedures as the
     Committee shall establish, to receive a distribution of his benefits 
     as provided in Article XI (or to retain the ability to make an
     election to receive such a distribution at any time) or
     (notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.11 to the contrary),
     solely for purposes of determining the Participant's Vested Percentage
     in his Profit Sharing Account and his Leveraged ESOP Account, to
     continue to be credited with Credited Service for employment with the
     Joint Venture.  If the Participant elects to continue to be credited
     with Credited Service for employment with the Joint Venture, his
     Accounts will subsequently be distributed by applying Article XI as if
     the Joint Venture were his sole Employer for the purpose of
     determining when such Participant thereafter has a Termination of
     Employment.  Service for periods of employment with the Joint Venture
     shall be determined by crediting each such electing Participant with
     one Year of Credited Service for each subsequent consecutive
     October 31 that such Participant is employed by the Joint Venture;
     provided that a Participant shall not receive more than one Year of
     Credited Service for a single Plan Year.

        11.16  In-Service Withdrawals.

               (a)  Investment Savings and Rollover Accounts.   A
          Participant may, upon written notice to the Committee, given
          before the administrative cutoff date prior to the end of any
          calendar month, withdraw all or any portion of such Participant's
          Investment Savings Account, Rollover Account and Rollover Holding
          Account valued as of the Valuation Date of the calendar month in
          which such notice is given.  Distribution of such withdrawals
          shall be made within the next calendar month.  The Committee may,
          from time to time, establish such rules and procedures as it
          deems appropriate to administer or limit the withdrawal of
          Participant and Rollovers under this Section 11.16 provided,
          however, that in no event shall the Committee limit Participants'
          rights of withdrawal to less than one withdrawal per Plan Year. 
          To the extent administratively feasible the period of notice
          required for withdrawal or distribution can be relaxed, reduced
          or eliminated upon appropriate request to the Committee.

               (b)  Stock Sharing Accounts.  A Participant may, on a form
          at such time and in such manner as the Committee shall prescribe,
          elect to have distributed to him in cash or in shares of common
          stock of the Company, the shares which have been allocated to his
          Stock Sharing Account for eighty-four (84) months following the
          month in which such shares were allocated to his Stock Sharing
          Account, providedhaat such withdrawals shall consist of whole
          shas..   As of the Effective Date all shares of common stock of
          the Company purchased with contributions to the Stock Sharing
          Plan have been held for more than 84 months and therefore may be
          distributed. 

        11.17  Direct Rollovers. 

               (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Program to the
          contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election
          under this Section 11.17, a Distributee whose benefit is
          distributable pursuant to another provision of the Program may
          elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Committee,
          to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid
          directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the
          Distributee in a Direct Rollover; subject to such reasonable
          administrative requirements as the Committee may from time to
          time establish which may include, but shall not be limited to,
          requirements consistent with Treasury Regulations and other
          guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service permitting de
          minimis standards for amounts eligible to be rolled over or paid
          partly to the Participant and partly rolled over.  A Participant
          may make an election pursuant to this Section 11.17 only after
          the Distributee has met otherwise applicable requirements for
          receipt of a distribution under the Program, including but not
          limited to any applicable requirements that the Participant's
          spouse or (pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as
          defined in Section 16.5) former spouse consent to the
          Participant's waiver of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or
          Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.

               If a Participant or Beneficiary elects to receive a Direct
          Rollover or a distribution in a form other than an annuity as
          provided in Section 11.2(a)(1)(C) or 11.3(a)(3)(C), such
          distribution may be made or commence to be made less than 30 days
          after the notice required under Section 1.411(a)-11(c) of the
          Income Tax Regulations is given, provided that:

                    (1)  the Committee shall clearly inform the Participant
               or Beneficiary that he has a right to a period of at least
               30 days after receiving the notice to consider the decision
               of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if
               applicable, a particular distribution option), and

                    (2)  the Participant or Beneficiary after receiving the
               notice affirmatively elects a distribution.


               (b)  In the absence of the adoption by the Committee of any
          requirements to the contrary, the following shall apply:

                    (1)  A Distributee whose Eligible Rollover Distribution
               is less than $200 upon the Valuation Date immediately
               preceding the date of distribution shall not be permitted to
               elect to have all or any portion of the distribution made in
               the form of a Direct Rollover.

                    (2)  A Distributee who elects a Direct Rollover in an
               amount equal to at least $500 may also elect to have the
               remaining portion of his distribution paid to the
               Distributee. 

                    (3)  A Distributee shall be permitted to divide an
               Eligible Rollover Distribution into separate distributions
               to be paid to two or more Eligible Retirement Plans in two
               or more Direct Rollovers.

                    (4)  A Distributee's election to make or not to make a
               Direct Rollover with respect to a payment in a series of
               periodic payments shall apply to all subsequent payments in
               the series until the Distributee changes his election.

                    (5)  If a Distributee, who has been notified as to the
               availability of the Direct Rollover option, fails to elect a
               Direct Rollover with respect to an Eligible Rollover
               Distribution, such Distributee shall be deemed to have
               elected not to make a Direct Rollover.  

               (c)  As used in this Section 11.17, the following terms
          shall have the following meanings:

                    (1)  "Eligible Rollover Distribution" means any
               distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
               credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover
               Distribution does not include:  any distribution that is one
               of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not
               less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
               expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint
               life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's
               designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten
               years or more; any distribution to the extent such
               distribution is required under Section 11.13; and the
               portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
               income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
               unrealized appreciation with respect to employer
               securities).

                    (2)  "Eligible Retirement Plan" means an individual
               retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the
               Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity
               described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an
               annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal
               Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in Section
               401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the
               Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distributions.  However, in
               the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to a
               Participant's surviving spouse or surviving former spouse
               who is a Distributee pursuant to a Qualified Domestic
               Relations Order, an Eligible Retirement Plan is an
               individual retirement account or individual retirement
               annuity.

                    (3)  "Distributee" means a Participant.  In addition, a
               Participant's surviving spouse and a former spouse who is
               the alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations
               Order are Distributees with regard to the interest of such
               spouse or former spouse. 

                    (4)  "Direct Rollover" means a payment by the Program
               to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the
               Distributee.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                            SUBSIDIARY PARTICIPATION

     other business entity in which the Company owns an interest) may, with
     the approval of the Board of Directors and under such terms and
     conditions as the Board of Directors may prescribe, adopt the Program
     and Trust by resolution of its board of directors (or approval of
     other appropriate persons in the case of a noncorporate entity);
     provided that the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Program can be adopted
     only by a corporation which is a Commonly Controlled Entity or another
     corporation included with the Company in a group defined in (a) or (b)
     below:

               (a)  a corporation whi is part of a group of corporations

          tier subsidiary and such subsidiary (and all other corporations
          below it in the chain) which would meet the 80 percent test of
          Section 1563(a) of the Code if the first tier subsidiary were the
          common parent); and

               (b)  a corporation which is part of a group of corporations
          in which a common parent owns directly stock possessing all of
          the voting power of all classes of stock and all of the
          non-voting stock in the first tier subsidiary and the first tier

          percent test of Section 1563(a) of the Code if the second tier
          subsidiary were a common parent).

          12.2   Withdrawal from Program by Participating Employer.  While it
     is not the present intention of any Employer to withdraw from the
     Program, any Employer other than the Company shall have the right, at
     any time, upon the approval of and under such conditions as may be
     provided by the Board of Directors, to withdraw from the Program and
     Trust by delivering to the Committee and the Trustee written notice of
     its election so to withdraw.

          Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the Accounts of
     Participants employed by the withdrawing Employer as of the date of
     withdrawal shall be fully vested and shall not thereafter be subject
     to Forfeiture unless such Participant shall transfer to another
     Employer as of the date of the withdrawal.  In the event of the
     withdrawal of an Employer, such Employer shall elect and notify the
     Committee of its election, whether the Net Balance Accounts of the 
     Participants employed by such Employer (a) shall be immediately
     distributable by the Trustee, (b) shall be retained in the Program and
     become distributable when such employees die, or otherwise terminate
     their employment with the Employer, or (c) if the Employer establishes
     a plan which meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code
     which plan permits a transfer from this Program to it by transfer of
     the Net Balance Accounts of Participants who are employees of such
     Employer to such Employer's plan to be held in separate accounts under
     such plan for the benefit of the respective Participants; provided
     that a distribution shall not be made to a Participant who is not
     otherwise entitled to a distribution in accordance with Article XI
     unless there has been a disposition of substantially all the assets
     used by the Employer in a trade or business and the Employee continues
     employment with the corporation acquiring such assets or the Company
     has disposed of its interest in the Employer and the Employee
     continues employment with the former Employer.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                         ADMINISTRATION OF The Program

        13.1   Appointment and Removal of, and Resignation by, Trustee. 
     The Board of Directors shall have the power to appoint a successor to
     a Trustee (including any one or more individuals acting as Trustee)
     which has resigned or been removed, to direct the Trustee to enter
     into a custodial agreement providing for deposit of all or any part of
     the Trust Fund with the custodian, and, with the consent of the
     Trustee, to appoint a co-Trustee.  The Trustee may resign at any time
     upon thirty (30) days' written notice (or such shorter period of time
     as the Board of Directors shall permit by written consent) to the
     Company and the Committee.  The Board of Directors shall have the
     power to remove the Trustee, with or without cause, upon written
     notice to the Trustee.

          The appointment of a successor Trustee or co-Trustee shall become
     effective upon acceptance in writing of such appointment by the
     successor Trustee or co-Trustee and upon acceptance of such
     appointment by the successor Trustee, the Trustee shall assign,
     transfer and pay over to the successor Trustee the Trust Fund.  The
     successor Trustee or co-Trustee may be either a corporate Trustee or
     an individual, and, except as required by federal law, the successor
     Trustee or co-Trustee shall not be personally liable for anything done
     or omitted to be done by a predecessor Trustee or co-Trustee prior to
     the appointment of the successor or co-Trustee or be required to
     examine the accounts, records or acts of any predecessor Trustee or
     co-Trustee.  Each successor Trustee appointed to and accepting a
     Trusteeship hereunder shall have all the rights, title, powers,
     duties, exemptions and limitations of the original Trustee.

        13.2   Appointment of Committee; Tenure in Office.  The
     administrative committee ("Committee") shall consist of not less than
     five (5) members who shall be appointed by the Board of Directors. 
     The Board of Directors shall have power to determine the period during
     which any Committee member shall serve and, in its discretion, may
     remove any member of the Committee at any time without assigning any
     reason therefore.  A Committee member may resign at any time by 
     written notice to the Chief Executive Officer or any Executive Vice
     President of the Company.  Upon a vacancy occurring, owing to the
     death, resignation or removal by the Board of Directors of any member
     of the Committee, a successor shall be appointed by the Board of
     Directors.  Until a vacancy in the Committee is filled by the Board of
     Directors, the remaining members of the Committee shall continue to
     act as the Committee.  The Board of Directors shall certify to the
     Trustee and the Committee the names of the members of the Committee
     and, thereafter, any change in its membership.

        13.3   Named Fiduciaries.  The Company, the Board of Directors, the
     Committee and every Participant, Beneficiary or Employee of the
     Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates who becomes a fiduciary by

     with respect to the administration and operation of the Program in
     accordance with Article XIII shall be "named fiduciaries" as provided
     in Section 402(a) of ERISA, and shall, accordingly, be afforded the
     protection provided for in Section 405(c)(2) of ERISA with respect to
     named fiduciaries.

        13.4   Delegation of Responsibilities.  The Committee and the Board
     of Directors shall have the authority, as it may deem advisable, to
     delegate, from time to time, by instrument in writing all or any part
     of its responsibilities under the Program (including the power to
     delegate) to such person or persons as it may deem suitable, and in
     the same manner to revoke any such delegation of responsibility. 
     Periodically the delegate shall report to the Committee or Board of
     Directors concerning the discharge of his delegated responsibilities.
     Any action of the delegate in the exercise of such delegated
     responsibilities shall have the same force and effect for all purposes
     hereunder as if such action had been taken by the Committee or the
     Board of Directors.  Neither the Committee, the Board of Directors nor
     any of their members shall be liable for the acts or omissions of such
     delegate except as otherwise required by Federal law.

          The Committee's authority to delegate in accordance with this
     Section 13.4 shall include, but not be limited to, authority to
     delegate all or any part of the responsibilities set forth in
     Section 13.5 to any department or employee of the Company or other

     present by telephone) by the consent of a majority of its members, or
     without a meeting by the unanimous written consent of its members. 

          No member of the Committee shall vote or decide upon any matter
     relating specifically to himself or to his specific rights or benefits
     under the Program.

          The Committee may authorize any of its members to execute on its
     behalf any document which reflects an action or decision of the
     Committee and the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
     names of its members so authorized.  Until the Committee revokes or
     alters such authorization by a written notice to the Trustee, the
     Trustee may accept and rely upon any document executed by such members
     as reflecting action by the Committee.

        13.7   Secretary.  The Committee shall appoint a Secretary (who
     may, but need not, be a member of the Committee) to keep records of

     to him in writing by the Committee.

     also a Participant or a Beneficiary shall receive any benefit to which
     he may be entitled as a Participant or Beneficiary in the Program so

     consistent with the terms of the Program as applied to all other
     Participants and Beneficiaries.

        13.9   Rules and Decisions.  The Committee may, from time to time,
     adopt or amend such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or
     desirable which are consistent with the provisions or the purposes of
     the Program.  All rules and decisions of the Committee shall be
     applied to all Participants in similar circumstances in a uniform and
     non-discriminatory manner.  In adopting, amending or applying its
     rules and regulations, the Committee shall be entitled to, but need
     not, rely upon information furnished by a Participant or Beneficiary,
     a delegate, an Employer or Employee, the Trustee or the Company.  All
     rules and regulations of the Committee shall be conclusive and binding
     upon Participants, spouses and Beneficiaries.

        13.10  Agents and Counsel.  The Committee and its delegates shall
     have the authority to appoint or employ individuals to assist or to
     advise in the administration of the Program and any other agent deemed
     advisable, including but not limited to, independent certified public

        13.12  Claims Procedure.

               (a)  Each Participant or Beneficiary (for purposes of this
          Section called a "Claimant") may submit his claim for benefits to
          the Plan Administrator in writing in such form as is permitted by
          the Committee.  A Claimant shall have no right to seek review of
          a denial of benefits, or to bring any action in any court to
          enforce a claim for benefits, prior to his filing a claim for
          benefits and exhausting his rights to review in accordance with
          this Section.

               When a claim for benefits has been filed properly, such
          claim for benefits shall be evaluedd and the Claimant shall be
          notified of the approval or the denial within ninety (90) days
          after the receipt of such claim unless special circumstances
          require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If such
          an extension of time for processing is required, written notice
          of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the
          termination of the initial ninety (90) day period, and such
          notice shall specify the special circumstances requiring an
          extension and the date by which a final decision will be reached
          (which date shall not be later than one hundred and eighty (180)
          days after the date on which the claim was filed).  A Claimant
          shall be given a written notice in which he shall be advised as
          to whether the claim is granted or denied, in whole or in part. 
          If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant shall be
          given written notice which shall contain (1) the specific reasons
          for the denial, (2) references to pertinent Plan provisions on
          which the denial is based, (3) a description of any additional
          material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an
          explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and
          (4) the Claimant's rights to seek review of the denial.

               (b)  If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant
          shall have the right to request that the Committee review the
          denial, provided that he files a written request for review with
          the Committee within sixty (60) days after the date on which he
          received written notification of the denial (or such longer
          period as the Committee for good cause may permit).  A Claimant
          (or his duly authorized representative) may review pertinent
          documents and submit issues and comments in writing to the
           Committee.  Within sixty (60) days after a request for review is
          received, the review shall be made and the Claimant shall be
          advised in writing of the decision on review, unless special
          circumstances require an extension of time for processing the
          review, in which case the Claimant shall, within such initial
          sixty (60) day period, be given a written notification specifying
          the reasons for the extension and when such review shall be
          completed (provided that such review shall be completed within
          one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date on which the
          request for review was filed).  The decision on review shall be
          forwarded to the Claimant in writing and shall include specific
          reasons for the decision and references to Plan provisions upon
          which the decision is based.  A decision on review shall be final
          and binding on all persons for all purposes.  If a Claimant shall 
          fail to file a request for review in accordance with the
          procedures herein outlined, such Claimant shall have no rights to
          review and shall have no right to bring action in any court, and
          the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on all
          persons for all purposes.

        13.13  Information to be Furnished to Committee.  The Company and
     Employers shall furnish the Committee or its delegate such evidence,
     data and information as the Committee or its delegate may reasonably
     request.  Participants and their Beneficiaries shall also furnish to
     the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee or
     its delegate shall request.

        13.14  Plan Administrator.  The Committee may appoint a Plan
     Administrator who may (but need not) be a member of the Committee; and
     in the absence of such appointment, the Committee shall be the Plan
     Administrator.

        13.15  Fiduciary as Participant.  A fiduciary who is also a
     Participant or a Beneficiary shall receive any benefit to which he may
     be entitled as a Participant or Beneficiary in the Program so long as
     such benefit is computed and paid on a basis that is consistent with
     the terms of the Program as applied to all other Participants and
     Beneficiaries.

        13.16  Fiduciary Responsibility.  If a Plan fiduciary acts in
     accordance with ERISA, Title I, Subtitle B, Part 4:

               (a)  in determining that a Participant's spouse has
          consented to the naming of a Beneficiary other than the spouse,
          in relying on a Participant's election to waive a Qualified Joint
          and Survivor Annuity or a qualified survivor annuity or a
          revocation of such an election, or in determining that the
          consent of the Participant's spouse may not be obtained because
          there is no spouse, the spouse cannot be located or other
          circumstances prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury by
          regulations, then to the extent of payments made pursuant to such
          consent, revocation or determination, the Program and its
          fiduciaries shall have no further liability;

               (b)  in treating a domestic relations order as being (or not
          being) a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, or, during any
          period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order
          is a Qualified Domestic Relations Order is being determined (by
          the Committee, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
          otherwise), in segregating in a separate account in the Program
          or in an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable
          to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been
          determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, in paying
          the amounts segregated or held in escrow to the person entitled
          thereto if within 18 months the domestic relations order (or a
          modification thereof) is determined to be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order, in paying such amounts to the person entitled
          thereto if there had been no order, if within 18 months the
          domestic relations order is determined not to be qualified or if
          the issue is not resolved within 18 months and in prospectively 
          applying a domestic relations order which is determined to be
          qualified after the close of the 18-month period, then the
          obligation of the Program and its fiduciaries to the Participant
          and each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any
          payment made pursuant to such acts.

                                  ARTICLE XIV

            AMENDMENT, TERMINATION, MERGER AND CONSOLIDATION OF PLAN

        14.1   Amendment.  The Board of Directors shall have the right, at
     any time and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or
     all of the provisions of the Program and the Trust Agreement, provided
     that no amendment shall authorize or permit any part of the Trust Fund
     to be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive
     benefit of the Participants or their beneficiaries, or permit any
     portion of the Trust Fund to revert to or become the property of any
     Employer, except as may be permitted under applicable law, regulations
     and rulings.  No amendment shall deprive any Participant or any
     Beneficiary of a deceased Participant of any of the benefits or of an
     optional form of benefit to which he is entitled under this Program
     with respect to contritiioons prevussly made or, except to the extent
     permitted in regulations and rulings issued by the Secretary of the
     Treasury, shall eliminate an optional form of benefit with respect to
     contributions previously made, nor shall any amendment decrease any
     Participant's Accounts provided that no amendment made in conformance
     to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or any other statute
     relating to employee's trusts, or any official regulations or rulings
     issued pursuant thereto, shall be considered prejudicial to the rights
     of any Participant or Beneficiary.  No amendment which affects the
     rights, duties or responsibilities of the Trustee may be made without
     the Trustee's written consent.

          The Committee shall have the same authority with respect to the
     adoption of amendments to the Program and the Trust Agreement as the
     Board of Directors in the following circumstances:

               (a)  to adopt amendments to the Program or Trust which the
          Committee determines are necessary or desirable for the Program
          to comply with or to obtain benefits or advantages under the
          provisions of applicable law, regulations or rulings or
          requirements of the Internal Revenue Service or other government
           administrative agency or of changes in such law, regulations,
          rulings or requirements; and

               (b)  to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic amendment
          that the Committee determines to be necessary or desirable that
          does not materially change benefits to Participants or their
          Beneficiaries or materially increase the Employers' contributions
          to the Program.

          The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by the
     Committee to the Board of Directors on a timely basis.

        14.2   Termination of Program By the Company.  Although it is the
     intention of the Company that this Program be permanent, the Company 
     reserves the right to terminate the Program and the Trust at any time,
     by delivering to the Committee, the Trustee and each Employer
     hereunder, written notice of termination.

          Upon termination of the Program or permanent discontinuance of
     Employer Contributions to the Program, the interest in his Net Balance
     Account of each Participant who is an Employee at the time of the
     termination, shall become fully vested.  Such vested Accounts, shall,
     however, be subject to readjustment as provided in Sections 10.14,
     10.15, 10.16, 10.17 and 10.19.  In the event of termination of this
     Program, the Board of Directors may direct that the Trustee continue
     the Trust for a specified period of time, or for such period of time,
     as the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may deem to be in the best
     interest of the Participants or their Beneficiaries.  In the absence
     of specific direction from the Board of Directors, the Trust assets
     shall be distributed by the Trustee to Participants under the options
     set forth in Section 11.2 hereof or to Beneficiaries under the options
     set forth in Section 11.3; provided, however, that Participant Elected
     Contributions shall be distributed only if (a) the Participant has a
     Termination of Employment, death or Disability, or has attained the
     age of 59-1/2, (b) the Program is terminated without the Employer's
     establishment or maintenance of another defined contribution plan
     (excluding a leveraged ESOP as defined in Code Section 4975(e)(7)) or
     (c) the Employer disposes of substantially all of its assets used in a
     trade or business or disposes of its interest in a subsidiary and the
     Employee continues employment with the corporation acquiring the
     assets or the subsidiary and if, in the case of a distribution made
     pursuant to Section 14.2(b) or (c) the distribution is made in the
     form of a single distribution of the entire balance to the credit of
     the Participant in a single taxable year.  Upon the partial
     termination of the Program the interest of each Participant whose
     employment is terminated on account of, or who is affected by, such
     partial termination shall become fully vested and such Participant's
     benefits shall be distributable to the extent permitted in the
     preceding sentence.  Sales of McDonald's Restaurants by the Company or
     another Employer will not constitute a partial termination unless such
     sale under all other facts and circumstances constitutes a partial
     termination.

        14.3   Merger, Consolidation, or Transfer of Assets.  This Program
     shall not be merged or consolidated with, nor shall any assets or
     liabilities be transferred to, any other plan, unless the benefits
     payable to each Participant if the Program were terminated immediately
     after such action would not be less than the benefits which would have
     been payable to each such Participant if the Program had been
     terminated immediately before such action.

        14.4   Transfer of Assets from Plans of Subsidiaries.  The Board of
     Directors may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, authorize and
     direct the transfer to the Trust of all (or any designated portion) of
     the assets of any defined contribution plan (the "Transferred Assets")
     which is a Related Plan.  The Transferred Assets, to the extent
     allocable to persons who are Participants in the Program, shall be
     held, managed and distributed for the benefit of participants of the
     Related Plan (the "Transferred Assets") subject to such terms and
     conditions as the Board of Directors and the board of directors (or 
     persons having authority similar to the board of directors of a
     corporation) of the Commonly Controlled Entity, if applicable, of the
     Company shall provide.

               (a)  The Trustee shall accept, under such terms and
          conditions as the Board of Directors shall provide for, all
          Transferred Assets.

               (b)  Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Board of
          Directors and the board of directors (or persons having authority
          similar to the board of directors of a corporation) of the
          Commonly Controlled Entity, if applicable, all Participants'
          interests in the Transferred Assets shall be 100 percent (100%)
          vested and non-forfeitable.

               (c)  The Committee shall keep separate records of account
          for each Participant's interests in the Transferred Assets.

               (d)  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
          Transferred Assets shall be held, managed, invested and
          distributed in the same manner (and subject to the same
          restrictions) as Rollovers as provided in Article VIII of the
          Program.

               (e)  Each Participant's Transferred Assets shall be
          distributable in the same manner as a Participant's Rollover
          Account; provided that the Participant can also elect any benefit
          option which was available with respect to the Transferred Assets
          under the Related Plan.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                              TOP HEAVY PROVISIONS

        15.1   Application.  The definitions in Section 15.2 shall apply
     under this Article XV and the special rules in Section 15.3 shall
     apply, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Program, for any
     Plan Year in which the Program is a Top Heavy Plan and for such other
     Plan Years as may be specified herein.  Anything in this Article XV to
     the contrary notwithstanding, if the Program is a multlee  employer
     plan as described in Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c), the
     provisions of this ArticleV  sshall be applied separately to each
     Employer (together with the businesses which with that Employer are
     Commonly Controlled Entities or members of an Affiliated Service
     Group) taking account of benefits under the plan provided to employees
     of the Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or members of an
     Affiliated Service Group because of service with that Employer or
     Commonly Controlled Entity.

        15.2   Special Top Heavy Definitions.  The following special
     definitions shall apply under this Article XV.

               (a)  "Aggregate Employer Contributions" means the sum of all
          Employer Contributions and Forfeitures under this Program
          allocated for a Participant to the Program and employer
          contributions and forfeitures allocated for the Participant to 
          all Related Defined Contribution Plans in the Aggregation Group;
          provided, however, that Participant Elected Contributions,
          Employer Matching Contributions and Special Section 401(k)
          Contributions shall not be included for Non-Key Employees.

               (b)  "Aggregation Group" means the group of plans in a
          Mandatory Aggregation Group, if any, that includes the Program,
          unless inclusion of Related Plans in the Permissive Aggregation
          Group in the Aggregation Group would prevent the Program from
          being a Top Heavy Plan, in which case "Aggregation Group" means
          the group of plans consisting of the Program and each other
          Related Plan in a Permissive Aggregation Group with the Program.

                    (1)  "Mandatory Aggregation Group" means each plan
               (considering the Program and Related Plans) that, during the
               Plan Year that contains the Determination Date or any of the
               four preceding Plan Years,

                         (A)  had a participant who was a Key Employee, or

                         (B)  was necessary to be considered with a plan in
                    which a Key Employee participated in order to enable
                    the plan in which the Key Employee participated to meet
                    the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410
                    of the Internal Revenue Code.

               If the Program is not described in (A) or (B) above, it
               shall not be part of a Mandatory Aggregation Group.

                    (2)  "Permissive Aggregation Group" means the group of
               plans consisting of (A) the plans, if any, in a Mandatory
               Aggregation Group with the Program, and (B) any other
               Related Plan, that, when considered as a part of the
               Aggregation Group, does not cause the Aggregation Group to
               fail to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and
               Section 410 of the Internal Revenue Code.  A Related Plan in
               (B) of the preceding sentence may include a simplified
               employee pension plan, as defined in Internal Revenue Code
               Section 408(k), and a collectively bargained plan, if when
               considered as a part of the Aggregation Group such plan does
               not cause the Aggregation Group to fail to satisfy the
               requirements of Section 401(a)(4) and Section 410 of the
               Internal Revenue Code considering, if the plan is a multiple
               employer plan as described in Internal Revenue Code Section
               413(c), benefits under the plan only to the extent provided
               to employees of the employer because of service with the
               employer and, if the plan is a simplified employee pension
               plan, only the employer's contribution to the plan.

               (c)  "Determination Date" means, with respect to a Plan
          Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year or, in the case of
          the first Plan Year, the last day of such Plan Year.  If the
          Program is aggregated with other plans in the Aggregation Group,
          the Determination Date for each other plan shall be, with respect
          to any Plan Year, the Determination Date for each such other plan 
          which falls in the same calendar year as the Determination Date
          for the Program.

               (d)  "Key Employee" means, for the Plan Year containing the
          Determination Date, any person or the beneficiary of any person
          who is an employee or former employee of an Employer, a Commonly
          Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group as
          determined under Internal Revenue Code Section 416(i) and who, at
          any time during the Plan Year containing the Determination Date
          or any of the four (4) preceding Plan Years (the "Measurement
          Period"), is a person described in paragraph (1), (2), (3) or
          (4), subject to paragraph (5).

                    (1)  An officer of the Employer, Commonly Controlled
               Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group who:

                         (A)  in any Measurement Period is an officer
                    during the Plan Year and has annual Considered
                    Compensation for the Plan Year in an amount greater
                    than fifty percent (50%) of the amount in effect under
                    Section 415(b)(1)(A) of Internal Revenue Code for the
                    calendar year in which such Plan Year ends ($120,000 in
                    1996, adjusted in subsequent years as determined in
                    accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
                    of the Treasury or his delegate pursuant to the
                    provisions of Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue
                    Code); and

               No more than a total of fifty (50) persons (or, if lesser,
               the greater of three (3) persons or ten percent (10%) of all
               persons or beneficiaries of persons who are employees or
               former employees) shall be treated as Key Employees under
               this paragraph (1) for any Measurement Period.  In the case
               of an Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
               Affiliated Service Group which is not a corporation in any
               Measurement Period, the term "officer" as used in this
               subsection (d) shall include administrative executives as
               described in Section 1.416-1(T-13) of the Treasury
               Regulations.

                    (2)  One (1) of the ten (10) persons who, during a Plan
               Year in the Measurement Period:

                         (A)  have annual Considered Compensation from the
                    Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
                    Affiliated Service Group for such Plan Year greater
                    than the amount in effect under Section 415(c)(1)(A) of
                    the Internal Revenue Code for the calendar year in
                    which such Plan Year ends (the greater of $30,000 for
                    1996 or one-fourth of the dollar limitation in effect
                    under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue
                    Code, adjusted in subsequent years as determined in
                    accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary
                    of the Treasury or his delegate pursuant to the
                    provisions of Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue
                    Code); and 

                         (B)  own (or are considered as owning within the
                    meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) in sh

                    Plan Year, the largest percentage interests in the
                    Employer, Commoy  CControlled Entity or member of an
                    Affiliated Service Group, in such Plan Year, provided
                    that no person shall be treated as a Key Employee under
                    this paragraph unless he owns more than one-half
                    percent (1/2%) interest in the Employer, Commonly
                    Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service
                    Group.

               No more than a total of ten (10) persons or beneficiaries of
               persons who are employees or former employees shall be
               treated as Key Employees under this paragraph (2) for any
               Measurement Period.

                    (3)  A person who, for a Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, is a more than five percent (5%) owner (or is
               considered as owning more than five percent (5%) within the
               meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) of the
               Employer, Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
               Affiliated Service Group.

                    (4)  A person who, for a Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, is a more than one percent (1%) owner (or is
               considered as owning more than one percent (1%) within the
               meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 318) of the
               Employer, a Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an
               Affiliated Service Group and has an annual Considered
               Compensation for such Plan Year from the Employer, Commonly
               Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group
               of more than $150,000.

                    (5)  If the number of persons who meet the requirements
               to be treated as Key Employees under paragraph (1) or (2)
               exceed the limitation on the number of Key Employees to be
               counted under paragraph (1) or (2), those persons with the
               highest annual Considered Compensation in a Plan Year in the
               Measurement Period for which the requirements are met and
               who are within the limitation on the number of Key Employees
               will be treated as Key Employees.

               If the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) are met by a
               person in more than one (1) Plan Year in the Measurement
               Period, each person will be counted only once under
               paragraph (1) or (2):

                         (A)  under paragraph (1), the Plan Year in the
                    Measurement Period in which a person who was an officer
                    and had the highest annual Considered Compensation
                    shall be used to determine whether the person will be
                    treated as a Key Employee under the preceding sentence;

                         (B)  under paragraph (2), the Plan Year in the
                    Measurement Period in which the ownership percentage 
                    interest is the greatest shall be used to determine
                    whether the person will be treated as a Key Employee
                    under the preceding sentence.

               Notwithstanding the above provisions of paragraph (5), a
               person may be counted in determining the limitation under
               both paragraphs (1) and (2).  In determining the sum of the
               Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key Employees under
               subsection (h) of this Section, the Present Value of Accrued
               Benefits for any person shall be counted only once.

               (e)  "Non-Key Employee" means (1) a person or the
          beneficiary of a person with an account balance in the Program or
          an account balance or accrued benefit in any Related Plan in the
          Aggregation Group or (2) an employee, a former employee or the
          beneficiary of such person who has received a distribution during
          the Measurement Period and (3) who during the Measurement Period
          is not a Key Employee.

               (f)  "Present Value of Accrued Benefits" means, for any Plan
          Year, an amount equal to the sum of (1), (2) and (3) for each
          person who, in the Plan Year containing the Determination Date,
          was a Key Employee or a Non-Key Employee.

                    (1)  Subject to (4) below, the value of a person's Net
               Balance Account under the Program and his accrued benefit
               under each Related Defined Contribution Plan in the
               Aggregation Group, determined as of the valuation date
               coincident with or immediately preceding the Determination
               Date, adjusted for contributions due as of the Determination
               Date, as follows:

                         (A)  in the case of a plan not subject to the
                    minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the
                    Internal Revenue Code, by including the amount of any
                    contributions actually made after the valuation date
                    but on or before the Determination Date, and, in the
                    first plan year of a plan, by including contributions
                    made after the Determination Date that are allocated as
                    of a date in that first plan year; and

                         (B)  in the case of a plan that is subject to the
                    minimum funding requirements, by including the amount
                    of any contributions that would be allocated as of a
                    date not later than the Determination Date, plus
                    adjustments to those amounts as required under
                    applicable rulings, even though those amounts are not
                    yet required to be contributed or allocated (e.g.,
                    because they have been waived) and by including the
                    amount of any contributions actually made (or due to be
                    made) after the valuation date but before the
                    expiration of the extended payment period in
                    Section 412(c)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code.

                    (2)  Subject to (4) below, the sum of the actuarial
               present values of a person's accrued benefits under each 
               Related Defined Benefit Plan in the Aggregation Group,
               expressed as a benefit commencing at Vesting Retirement Date
               (or the person's attained age, if later) determined based on
               the following actuarial assumptions:

                         (A)  Interest rate 5%; and

                         (B)  Post Retirement Mortality: 1984 Unisex
                    Pension Table;

               and determined in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
               Section 416(g), provided, however, that if a defined benefit
               plan in the Aggregation Group provides for different or
               additional actuarial assumptions to be used in determining
               the present value of accrued benefits thereunder for the
               purpose of determining the top heavy status thereof, then
               such different or additional actuarial assumptions shall
               apply with respect to each defined benefit plan in the
               Aggregation Group, and further provided that the accrued
               benefit of any Non-Key Employee shall be determined under
               the method which is used for accrual purposes for all
               Related Defin BBeenefit Plans or, if no single accrual
               meodd  is used in all such plans, such accrued benefit shall
               be determined as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly
               than the slowest accrual rate permitted under Section
               411(b)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.

               The present value of an accrued benefit for any person who
               is employed by an employer maintaining a plan on the
               Determination Date is determined as of the most recent
               valuation date which is within a 12-month period ending on
               the Determination Date, provided however that:

                         (C)  for the first plan year of the plan, the
                    present value for an employee is determined as if the
                    employee had a Termination of Employment (i) on the
                    Determination Date or (ii) on such valuation date but
                    taking into account the estimated accrued benefit as of
                    the Determination Date; and

                         (D)  for the second and subsequent plan years of
                    the plan, the accrued benefit taken into account for an
                    employee is not less than the accrued benefit taken
                    into account for the first plan year unless the
                    difference is attributable to using an estimate of the
                    accrued benefit as of the Determination Date for the
                    first plan year and using the actual accrued benefit as
                    of the Determination Date for the second plan year.

               For purposes of this paragraph (2), the valuation date is
               the valuation date used by the plan for computing plan costs
               for minimum funding, regardless of whether a valuation is
               performed that year.

                    If the plan provides for a nonproportional subsidy as
               described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.416-1 (T-27), 
               the present value of accrued benefits shall be determined
               taking into account the value of nonproportional subsidized
               early retirement benefits and nonproportional subsidized
               benefit options.

                    (3)  Subject to (4) below, the aggregate value of
               amounts distributed during the plan year that includes the
               Determination Date or any of the four preceding plan years
               including amounts distributed under a terminated plan which,
               if it had not been terminated, would have been in the
               Aggregation Group.

                    (4)  The following rules shall apply in determining the
               Present Value of Accrued Benefits:

                         (A)  Amounts attributable to qualified voluntary
                    employee contributions, as defined in Section 219(e) of
                    the Internal Revenue Code, shall be excluded.

                         (B)  In computing the Present Value of Accrued
                    Benefits with respect to rollovers or plan-to-plan
                    transfers, the following rules shall be applied to
                    determine whether amounts which have been distributed
                    during the five (5) year period ending on the
                    Determination Date from or accepted into this Program
                    or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be included
                    in determining the Present Value of Accrued Benefits:

                              (i)  Unrelated Transfers made from the
                         Program or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall
                         be included.

                              (ii) Related Transfers made from the Program
                         or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall not be
                         included by the transferor plan (but shall be
                         counted by the accepting plan).

               The accrued benefit of any individual who has not performed
          services for an Employer maintaining the Program at any time
          during the five (5) year period ending on the Determination Date
          shall be excluded in computing the Present Value of Accrued
          Benefits.

               (g)  "Related Transfer" means a rollover or a plan-to-plan
          transfer which is either not initiated by the Employee or is made
          between plans each of which is maintained by a Commonly
          Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service Group.

               (h)  A "Top Heavy Aggregation Group" means an Aggregation
          Group in any Plan Year for which, as of the Determination Date,
          the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key
          Employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group exceeds sixty
          percent (60%) of the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits
          for all employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group;
          provided that, for purposes of determining the sum of Present
          Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees, former Key Employees 
          who have not performed any services for an Employer, a Commonly
          Controlled Entity or a member of an Affiliated Service Group in
          the Plan Year containing the Determination Date or the preceding
          four Plan Years shall be excluded entirely from the calculation
          of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for the Plan Year that
          contains the Determination Date.  For purposes of applying the
          special rules herein with respect to a Super Top Heavy Plan, a
          Top Heavy Aggregation Group will also constitute a "Super Top
          Heavy Aggregation Group" if in any Plan Year as of the
          Determination Date, the sum of the Present Value of Accrued
          Benefits for Key Employees under all plans in the Aggregation
          Group exceeds ninety percent (90%) of the sum of the Present
          Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees under all plans in
          the Aggregation Group.

               (i)  "Top Heavy Plan" means the Program in any Plan Year in
          which it is a member of a Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including
          a Top Heavy Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Program. 
          For purposes of applying the rules herein with respect to a Super
          Top Heavy Plan, a Top Heavy Plan will also constitute a "Super
          Top Heavy Plan" if the Program in any Plan Year is a member of a
          Super Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including a Super Top Heavy
          Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Program.

               (j)  "Unrelated Transfer" means a rollover or a plan-to-plan
          transfer which is both initiated by the Employee and (1) made
          from a plan maintained by a Commonly Controlled Entity or member
          of an Affiliated Service Group to a plan maintained by an
          employer which is not a Commonly Controlled Entity or member of
          an Affiliated Service Group or (2) made to a plan maintained by a
          Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service
          Group from a plan maintained by an employer which is not a
          Commonly Controlled Entity or member of an Affiliated Service
          Group.

        15.3   Special Top Heavy Provisions.  For each Plan Year in which
     the Program is a Top Heavy Plan, the following rules shall apply,
     except that the special provisions of this Section 15.3 shall not
     apply with respect to any employee included in a unit of employees
     covered by an agreement which the Secretary of Labor finds to be a
     collective-bargaining agreement between employee representatives and
     one or more employers if there is evidence that retirement benefits 
     were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee
     representative and the Employer or Employers:

               (a)  Minimum Employer Contributions.  In any Plan Year in
          which the Program is a Top Heavy Plan, the Employers shall make
          additional Employer Contributions to the Program as necessary for
          each Participant who is employed on the last day of the Plan Year
          and who is a Non-Key Employee to bring the amount of his 
          Aggregate Employer Contributions for the Plan Year up to at least
          three percent (3%) of his Considered Compensation, or such lesser
          amount as is equal to the largest percentage of a Key Employee's
          Considered Compensation allocated to the Key Employee as
          Aggregate Employer Contributions.

          For purposes of determining whether a NOn-Key Employee is a
          Participant entitled to have minimum Employer Contributions made
          on his behalf, a Non-Key Employee will be treated as a
          Participant even if he is not otherwise a Participant (or accrues
          no benefit) under the Program because:

                    (1)  he has failed to complete the requisite number
               of hours of service (if any) after becoming a Participant in
               the Program,

                    (2)  he is excluded from participation in the Prgram
               (or accrues no benefit) merely because his compensation is
               less than a stated amount, or

                    (3)  he is excluded from participation in the Program
               (or accrues no benefit) merely because of a failure to make
               mandatory employee contributions or because of a failure to
               make elective 401(k) contribution.

               (b)  Vesting.  For each Plan Year in which the Program is a
          Top Heavy Plan and for each Plan Year thereafter, the vested right
          of each Participant who has an Hour of Service after the Program
          becomes a Top Heavy Plan to a percentage of his Profit Sharing
          Account and Employer Leveraged ESOP Account (to the extent such
          Accounts had not been forfeited prior to the Program's becoming
          a Top Heavy Plan) shall be determined under the following table:

               Year of Credited Service      Vested Percentage
               ------------------------      -----------------

               Less than 2                         0%
               2 but less than 3                  20
               3 but less than 4                  40
               4 but less than 5                  60
               5 but less than 6                  80
               6 or more                         100

               (c)  Limitations.  In computing the limitations under
          Article IX hereof for years in which the Program is a Top Heavy
          Plan, the special rules of Section 416(h) of the Code shall be
          applied in accordance with applicable regulations and rulings so
          that, in determining the denominator of the defined contribution
          plan fraction, as defined in Section 415(e)(3) of the Internal
          Revenue Code ("Defined Contribution Plan Fraction") and the
          defined benefit plan fraction as defined in Section 415(e)(2) of
          the Internal Revenue Code ("Defined Benefit Plan Fraction") at
          each place at which "1.25" would have been used, "1.00" shall be
          substituted and by substituting $41,500 for $51,875 in the
          numerator of the transition fraction described in Section 
          415(e)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, unless the Program is
          not a Super Top Heavy Plan and the special requirements of 
          Section 416(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code have been
          satisfied.

               (d)  Transition Rule for a Top Heavy Plan.  Notwithstanding
          the provisions of Section 15.3(c), for each Plan Year in which 
          the Program is a Top Heavy Plan and in which the Program does not
          meet the special requirements of Section 416(h)(2) of the 
          Internal Revenue Code in order to use 1.25 in the denominator of
          the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction and the Defined Benefit
          Plan Fraction, if an Employee was a participant in one or more
          defined benefit plans and in one or more defined contribution
          plans maintained by the Employer before the plans became Top
          Heavy Plans and if such Participant's Combined Fraction exceeds
          1.00 because of accruals and additions that were made before the
          plans became Top Heavy Plans, a factor equal to the lesser of
          1.25 or such lesser amount (but not less than 1.00) as shall be
          needed to make the Employee's Combined Fraction equal to 1.00
          shall be used in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan
          Fraction and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction if there are
          no further accruals or annual additions under any Top Heavy
          Plans until the Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater
          than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used in the denominators of
          the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the Defined Contribution
          Plan Fraction.  Any provisions herein to the contrary
          notwithstanding, if the Program is a Top Heavy Plan and the
          Program does not meet the special requirements of Section
          416(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code in order to use 1.25 in
          the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the
          Defined Contribution Plan Fraction, there shall be no further
          Annual Additions for a Participant whose Combined Fraction is
          greater than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used in the
          denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the Defined
          Contribution Plan Fraction, until such time as the Participant's
          Combined Fraction is not greater than 1.00.

               (e)  Transition Rule for a Super Top Heavy Plan.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.3(c) and 15.3(d),
          for each Plan Year in which the Program is a Super Top Heavy Plan,
          (1) if an Employee was a participant in one or more defined
          benefit plans and in one or more defined contribution plans
          maintained by the employer before the plans became Super Top Heavy
          Plans, and (2) if such Participant's Combined Fraction exceeds
          1.00 because of accruals and additions that were made before the
          plans became Super Top Heavy Plans and if immediately before the
          plans became Super Top Heavy Plans the Combined Fraction as then
          computed did not exceed 1.00, then a factor equal to the lesser of
          1.25 or such lesser amount (but not less than 1.00) as shall be
          needed to make the Employee's Combined Fraction equal to 1.00 shall
          be used in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction
          and the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction if there are no 
          further accruals or annual additions under any Super Top Heavy
          Plans until the Participant's Combined Fraction is not greater
          than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is used in the denominators of
          the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and the Defined Contribution
          Plan Fraction.  Any provisions herein to the contrary
          notwithstanding, if the Program is a Super Top Heavy Plan, there
          shall be no further Annual Additions for a Participant whose
          Combined Fraction is greater than 1.00 when a factor of 1.00 is
          used in the denominator of the Defined Benefit Plan Fraction and
          the Defined Contribution Plan Fraction until the Participant's
          Combined Fraction is not greater than 1.00

               (f)  Terminated Plan.  If the Program becomes a Top Heavy
          Plan after it has formally been terminated, has ceased crediting
          for benefit accruals and vesting and has been or is distributing
          all plan assets to participants and their beneficiaries as soon
          as administratively feasible or if a terminated plan has
          distributed all benefits of participants and their beneficiaries,
          the provisions of Section 15.3 shall not apply to the Program.

               (g)  Frozen Plans.  If the Program becomes a Top Heavy Plan
          after contributions have ceased under the Program but all assets
          have not been distributed to participants or their beneficiaries,
          the provisions of Section 15.3 shall apply to the Program.

                                  ARTICLE XVI

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        16.1   Headings.  Headings of sections and subsections of the
     Program are inserted for convenience of reference and are neither part
     of the Program nor to be considered in the construction thereof.

        16.2   Indemnification.  Each member of the Committee, each member
     of the Board of Directors, each individual serving as Trustee without
     compensation, and each and every Employee to whom are delegated
     duties, responsibilities and authority with respect to the Program and
     the Trust shall be indemnified, held harmless and promptly reimbursed
     by the Company against all claims, liabilities, fines and penalties
     and all expenses (including, but not limited to, attorney fees)
     reasonably incurred by or imposed upon such member, individual or
     Employee which arise as a result of his actions or failure to act in
     connection with the operation and administration of the Program and
     the Trust, to the extent lawfully allowable; provided that to the
     extent that such claim, liability, fine, penalty or expense is paid
     for by liability insurance purchased by or paid for by the Company,
     reimbursement shall be limited to amounts which would not cause the
     loss of coverage under such insurance and further provided that to the
     extent that the Company has reimbursed the Employee, the Company shall
     be subrogated to the Trustee's rights to reimbursement under such
     insurance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
     indemnify any person for any such amount incurred through any
     settlement or compromise of any action unless the Company consents in
     writing to such settlement or compromise.  Expenses incurred in
     defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid
     by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action,
     suit or proceeding as authorized by the Company in the specific case
     upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the member of the
     Committee, member of the Board of Directors, individual Trustee or
     Employee to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined
     that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized in
     this Section 16.2.

        16.3   Employees' Trust.  This Program is created for the exclusive
     purpose of providing benefits to the Participants in the Program and
     their Beneficiaries, and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
     with its being a Plan described in Section 401(a) of the Internal
     Revenue Code and with the Trust's being a Trust exempt under Section
     501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

        16.4   Nonalienation of Benefits.  Benefits payable under this
     Program shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation,
     alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge,
     garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or
     involuntary, prior to actually being received by the person entitled
     to the benefit under the terms of the Program; and any attempt to
     anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber,
     charge, garnish, execute on, levy or otherwise dispose of any right to
     benefits payable hereunder, shall be void.  The Trust Fund shall not
     in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts,
     liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits
     hereunder.  The foregoing provisions of this Section 16.4(a) shall not
     preclude the (1) enforcement of a Federal tax levy made pursuant to
     Section 6331 of the Internal Revenue Code or (2) collection by the
     United States on a judgment resulting from an unpaid tax assessment.

        16.5   Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

               (a)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order means any judgment,
          decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement
          agreement):

                    (1)  which is made pursuant to a state domestic
               relations law (including a community property law),

                    (2)  which relates to the provision of child support,
               alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse,
               former spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant,

                    (3)  which creates or recognizes the existence of an
               alternate payee's right to receive all or a portion of the
               Participant's Net Balance Account under the Program, and

                    (4)  with respect to which the requirements of
               paragraphs (b) and (c) are met.

               (b)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order only if such order clearly specifies:

                    (1)  the name and the last known mailing address, if
               any, of the Participant and the name and mailing address of
               each alternate payee covered by the order,

                    (2)  the amount or percentage of the Participant's
               Accrued Benefit to be paid by the Program to each such
               alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or
               percentage is to be determined,

                    (3)  the number of payments or period to which such
               order applies, and 

                    (4)  each Plan to which such order applies.

               (c)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order only if such order does not:

                    (1)  require the plan to provide any type or form of
               benefit, or any option not otherwise provided under the
               Program,

                    (2)  require the Program to provide increased benefits
               (determined on the basis of actuarial value), or

                    (3)  require the payment of benefits to an alternate
               payee which are required to be paid to another alternate
               payee under another order previously determined to be a
               Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

               (d)  In the case of any payment before a Participant has had
          a Termination of Employment, a domestic relations order shall not
          be treated as failing to meet the requirements of Section
          16.5(c)(1) solely because such order requires that payment of
          benefits be made to an alternate payee:

                    (1)  without regard to the Participant's attainment of
               ansppeecified age;

                    (2)  as if the Participant had retired on the date on
               which such payment is to begin under such order; and

                    (3)  in any form in which such benefits may be paid
               under the Program to the Participant (other than in the form
               of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity with respect to
               the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).

               (e)  To the extent provided in any Qualified Domestic
          Relations Order the former spouse of a Participant if married to
          the Participant for at least one year, shall be treated as the
          surviving spouse of such Participant for purposes of consenting
          to the waiver of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity as
          provided in Sections 11.2(f) and 11.10 and the naming of another
          Beneficiary to the extent provided in Sections 11.3 and 11.10.

               (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article X,
          if, pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, a
          segregated account is established containing the interest of an
          alternate payee, the alternate payee shall direct the manner in
          which such segregated account shall be invested in accordance
          with the procedures under Article X; provided that such
          segregated account shall remain invested in the same manner as
          the assets were invested before the account was segregated until
          the alternate payee's election in accordance with this
          Section 16.5(f) becomes effective.

        16.6   Unclaimed Amounts.  Unclaimed amounts shall consist of the
     amounts of the Accounts of a retired, deceased or terminated
     Participant (including amounts held in the Holding Fund with respect 
     to checks which are distributed but which are not cashed) which cannot
     be distributed because of the Committee's inability, after a
     reasonable search, to locate a Participant or his Beneficiary within a
     period of two (2) years after the payment of benefits becomes due.

               (a)  Unclaimed amounts with respect to Accounts held in the
          Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Program for a Plan Year shall
          become a Forfeiture and shall be allocated for such Plan Year as
          determined in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, within a
          reasonable time after the close of the Plan Year in which such
          two-year period shall end.

               (b)  The Committee shall allocate Forfeitures with respect
          to Accounts held in the McDESOP portion of the Program to
          Participants' Participant Elected Contribution Accounts and
          Employer Matching Contribution Accounts by crediting such
          Forfeitures to the McDESOP and Leveraged ESOP Holding Fund as of
          the Valuation Date following the date the amount of such
          Forfeitures is determined for the immediately preceding Plan year
          but not later than March 31 of the year following the Plan year
          with respect to which such Forfeitures occurred.

               (c)  Forfeitures arising in respect to a Leveraged ESOP
          Account to Participants' Leveraged ESOP Accounts shall be
          allocated in the same manner as Forfeitures under Section 7.3 are
          allocated to such Accounts.

               (d)  As of the last day of the Plan Year, Forfeitures
          arising in respect to the Stock Sharing Accounts of Participants
          shall be charged with the expenses of the Stock Sharing portion
          of the Program without regard to the limitations on reimbursement
          for expenses prescribed by Section 409(l) of the Internal Revenue
          Code.  Any net Forfeitures after such charges and charges
          pursuant to Section 16.6(e) shall be allocated as income of the
          Stock Sharing portion of the Program as provided in Section
          10.13(b).

               (e)  If an unclaimed amount is subsequently properly claimed
          by the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary ("Reclaimed
          Amount") and unless an Employer in its discretion makes a
          contribution to the Program for such year in an amount sufficient
          to pay such Reclaimed Amount, it shall be charged as follows:

                    (1)  To the extent such Reclaimed Amount originated as
               an unclaimed amount with respect to the Accounts held in the
               Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Program, it shall be
               charged against Forfeitures from the Profit Sharing portion
               of the Program and, if such Forfeitures are not sufficient,
               the remainder shall be treated as an expense of the Profit
               Sharing Plan portion of the Program during the Plan Year in
               which the Participant or Beneficiary makes such claim.

                    (2)  To the extent that the Reclaimed Amount originated
               as an unclaimed amount with respect to the amounts held in
               the McDESOP portion of the Program it shall be charged
               against Forfeitures for the Plan Year with respect to 
               Participants' Participant Elected Contribution Accounts and
               Employer Matching Contribution Accounts and, to the extent
               such Forfeitures are not sufficient, shall be treated as an
               expense of the McDESOP portion of the Program.

                    (3)  To the extent that such Reclaimed Amount
               originated as an unclaimed amount in respect to an Leveraged
               ESOP Account, it shall be treated as a charge against
               Forfeitures arising under Sections 11.4 and 16.6 for the
               Plan Year with respect to Participants' Leveraged ESOP
               Accounts and, to the extent such Forfeitures are not
               sufficient, shall be treated as an expense of the Leveraged
               ESOP portion of the Program.

                    (4)  To the extent that such Reclaimed Amount
               originated as an unclaimed amount with respect to a Stock
               Sharing Account, it shall be treated as a charge against
               Forfeitures arising under Section 16.6 for the Plan Year
               with respect to Participants' Stock Sharing Accounts and, to
               the extent that such Forfeitures are not sufficient, shall
               be treated as an expense of the Stock Sharing portion of the
               Program.

        16.7   Maximum Age Condition.  Anything to the contrary herein
     notwithstanding, eligibility to participate in the Program and to
     elect or receive allocations of contributions to the Trust shall not
     be subject to any restrictions on account of a maximum age condition.

        16.8   Invalidity of Certain Provisions.  If any provision of this
     Program shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
     unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and
     this Program shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions, to
     the extent invalid or unenforceable, had not been included.

        16.9   Gender and Number.  Except when otherwise indicated by the
     context, any masculine terminology herein shall also include the

                               McDONALD'S

             SUPPLEMENTAL EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EQUALIZATION PLAN

                               ("McCAP II")
                                McDONALD'S

             SUPPLEMENTAL EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EQUALIZATION PLAN
                                (McCAP II)

                                 Section 1

                               Introduction


     1.1  The Plan and Its Effective Date.  The McDonald's
  Supplemental Employee Benefit Equalization Plan (formerly, the
  McDonald's 1986 Tax Reform Equalization Plan) as amended and
  restated, effective January 1, 1989 and again amended and
  restated January 1, 1990 (the "Plan" or "McCAP II") is hereby
  amended and restated, effective January 1, 1996, except as
  otherwise provided herein.  The Plan provides certain benefits
  previously provided by McDonald's 1986 Tax Reform Equalization
  Plan with respect to years before January 1, 1989 and certain
  additional benefits.

     1.2  Purpose.  McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's" or the
  "Company") maintains the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing
  Program ("Profit Sharing Program") which has four components, the
  Profit Sharing Plan, McDESOP, the Leveraged ESOP and the
  McDonald's Stock Sharing Plan which are intended to meet the
  requirements of a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the
  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  Code
  Section 402(g) generally limits to $9,500 (in 1996, as adjusted
  in subsequent years by the Secretary of Treasury for cost of
  living adjustments in accordance with Code Section 402(g)(5)) the
  maximum amount of employee elective deferrals under a qualified
  plan ("Elective Contribution Limit"); Code Section 401(a)(17)
  limits to $150,000 (in 1996, as adjusted in subsequent years as
  provided by the Secretary of the Treasury) the amount of
  compensation which may be taken into account for a Plan Year
  under a qualified plan ("Compensation Limit"); and elective
  deferrals to a nonqualified plan are not taken into account in
  determining compensation and benefits under the qualified plans
  ("Elective Deferral Exclusions") (such limits and exclusion are
  collectively referred to herein as the "Limits").

      However, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
  as amended ("ERISA"), permits the provision of benefits under an
  unfunded plan maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose
  of providing deferred compensation for a select group of
  management or highly compensated employees.  The purpose of the
  Plan is to provide benefits to eligible employees which would be
  provided under the Profit Sharing Program as in effect on
  January 1, 1989, and thereafter, as from time to time amended,
  but which are not provided thereunder because of the Limits,
  subject to the requirement that the benefits provided under this
  Plan shall be determined as though the only employee elected
  deferrals of an Active Participant, as defined in Section 2.1,
  are the Participant Elected Contributions elected under the
  McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program, the Profit Sharing
  Program Equalization Plan ("McEqual"), the McDonald's 1989
  Executive Equalization Plan ("McCAP I") and under Section 2.4
  hereof.  In determining the amounts to be credited to the
  accounts of an Active Participant, as defined in Section 2.1,
  during a calendar year under the Plan, McEqual, McCAP I, and the
  Profit Sharing Program, the Committee may make assumptions based
  upon reasonable estimates and, as necessary, make subsequent
  adjustments to the extent the estimates prove to be incorrect.

      1.3. Defined Terms.  Except as otherwise indicated
  capitalized terms used in this plan document which are not
  defined herein have the same meaning as the same term in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program.


                              Section 2

                     Participation and Benefits

     2.1  Eligibility for Benefits.  Before the beginning of each
  calendar year, the Committee shall designate as eligible to be
  credited with benefits under the Plan for such year a select
  group of management or highly compensated employees of the
  Company or any other entity which has adopted the Plan in
  accordance with Section 4 who are not active participants under
  McCAP I for such year ("Active Participants").  Persons to be
  designated as Active Participants from the group of employees who
  first become participants in the Profit Sharing Program during a
  calendar year shall be designated by the Committee on or before
  their Profit Sharing Program Entry Date.  A person who was a
  participant in McDonald's 1986 Tax Reform Equalization Plan for
  periods before January 1, 1989 or who becomes an Active
  Participant thereafter shall remain a participant ("Participant")
  until all amounts credited to his account under the Plan
  ("McCAP II Account") have been distributed.

      2.2  Amount of Benefits.  The amount credited to an Active
  Participant's McCAP II Account for a calendar year shall equal
  (a) the amount, if any, the Active Participant would have
  received under the Profit Sharing Program for that year
  (including, if the Active Participant pursuant to Section 2.4 so
  elects, the amount of any elections of Participant Elected
  Contributions made by the Active Participant and any associated
  Matching Contributions) in the absence of the limitations under
  Section 415 of the Code as stated in Article IX thereof
  ("415 Limits") and in the absence of the Limits reduced by
  (b) the sum of the amounts allocated to such Participant's
  accounts under the Profit Sharing Program and amounts credited to
  the Participant's account under McEqual for the calendar year
  ("Annual Benefit Credits").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1)
  any amount distributed to a participant in the Profit Sharing
  Program in accordance with Sections 4.1(c), 5.2(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4
  of the Program shall be considered an amount which was received
  under the Profit Sharing Program in the calendar year for which
  the amount was contributed to the Profit Sharing Program (or
  would have been so contributed in the absence of the Limits) and
  (2) an Active Participant who does not have an election in effect
  under Section 2.4 for a calendar year shall not be credited with
  any Participant Elected Contributions or Employer Matching
  Contributions hereunder for that calendar year.

      2.3  Accounts and Income Credits.  Amounts credited to a
  Participant's McCAP II Account for periods before January 1, 1996
  shall be credited to Participant's McCAP II Accounts as provided
  by the Plan as then in effect.  Such amounts and amounts credited
  to a Participant's McCAP II Account with respect to periods after
  December 31, 1995 shall be credited with net earnings, gains and
  losses as described below:

           (a)  McCAP II Profit Sharing Investment Account.  The
      portion of a Participant's Annual Benefit Credits which, in
      the absence of the Limits, would have been Employer Profit
      Sharing Contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan portion of
      the Profit Sharing Program, shall be credited to the
      Participant's McCAP II Profit Sharing Investment Account for
      a calendar year.  A Participant's McCAP II Profit Sharing
      Investment Account shall also be credited with any amounts
      with respect to which a Participant has made a
      Diversification Election, as provided in Section 2.5, and any
      amounts subject to any election made by the Participant
      pursuant to Section 2.6.  A Participant's McCAP II Profit
      Sharing Investment Account shall be credited with net
      earnings, gains and losses as of each Valuation Date under
      the Profit Sharing Program in an amount equal to the amount
      which such account would have earned, gained or lost if at
      all times fully invested in the same manner as the
      Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account under the Profit
      Sharing Program.

           (b)  McCAP II McDonald's Common Stock Account.  Subject
      to Section 2.5, the portion of a Participant's Annual Benefit
      Credits which, in the absence of the Limits, would have been
      credited to such Active Participant's accounts under the
      Profit Sharing Program with respect to Participant Elected
      Contributions, Employer Matching Contributions and Employer
      Leveraged ESOP Contributions shall be credited to the
      Participant's McCAP II McDonald's Common Stock Account for a
      calendar year.  A Participant's McCAP II McDonald's Common
      Stock Account shall be credited with net earnings, gains and
      losses as of each Valuation Date under the Profit Sharing
      Program in an amount equal to the amount which such account
      would have earned, gained or lost if such amounts and the
      income credited thereon were at all times fully invested in
      the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund.

     2.4  Deferral Elections.  Each person who is a participant in
  the Profit Sharing Program and who is designated by the Committee
  as an Active Participant with respect to each calendar year may
  elect by filing a written election with the Committee, in
  accordance with such rules and procedures as the Committee shall
  establish, before the beginning of each subsequent calendar year,
  to have the Participant Elected Contributions and Employer 
  Matching Contributions described in Section 2.2, if any, credited
  to his McCAP II Account.  An employee who becomes a participant
  in the Profit Sharing Program during a year who is designated by
  the Committee as an Active Participant hereunder, may elect
  within 60 days of the date he becomes a participant in the Profit
  Sharing Program to have the Participant Elected Contributions and
  Employer Matching Contributions, if any, described in Section 2.2
  credited to his McCAP II Account.  

      If an Active Participant has an election pursuant to this
  Section 2.4 in effect for a calendar year, such election and the
  Active Participant's elected deferrals under McDESOP may not be
  changed during the year.  If an Active Participant does not have
  an election in effect pursuant to this Section 2.4 for the
  calendar year, any amounts of Participant Elected Contributions
  in excess of the Elective Contribution Limit which are elected by
  such Participant under the McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing
  Program either shall not be contributed or shall be returned to
  him as provided thereunder and no benefit shall be credited to
  him hereunder with respect to his Participant Elected
  Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions under the
  Profit Sharing Program.

     2.5 Diversification of Investments.  If a Participant makes a
  Diversification Election in accordance with Section 10.10 of the
  Profit Sharing Program (the "Diversification Election"), his
  corresponding McCAP II accounts and subaccounts containing the
  contributions and income with respect thereto which, if not for
  the Limits, would have been credited to his accounts under the
  McDESOP or the Leveraged ESOP portions of the Profit Sharing
  Program shall to the same extent be credited to the Participant's
  McCAP II Profit Sharing Investment Account and shall thereafter
  be credited with income as provided in Section 2.3(a). 

     2.6 Transfers to the Profit Sharing Investment Account.  A
  Participant may make an irrevocable election to have all amounts
  which have been credited to his McCAP II McDonald's Common Stock
  Account through March 31, 1991, which represent amounts which
  except for the Limits would have been credited to the Profit
  Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program and any
  accumulated income credited thereon, credited with earnings,
  gains and losses as of each Valuation Date, as defined in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program, equal to the amount which such
  credited amounts would have earned, gained or lost if at all
  times after the effective date of such election such amounts and
  the income credited thereon had been fully invested in the
  Participant's McCAP II Profit Sharing Investment Account.  Any
  election made pursuant to this Section shall be completed,
  delivered to the Committee and made effective in such manner and
  at such time as the Committee shall determine in accordance with
  its rules concerning the manner of making investment elections
  under the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing
  Program.

     2.7  Vesting.  A Participant shall be vested in the portions
  of his McCAP II Account which in the absence of the Limits would
  have been allocated to his Profit Sharing Account under the
  Profit Sharing Program and the earnings, gains or losses thereon
  to the same extent he is vested in his Profit Sharing Account
  under the Profit Sharing Program.  A Participant shall be vested
  in the portions of his McCAP II Account which in the absence of
  the Limits would have been allocated to his Leveraged ESOP
  Account under the Profit Sharing Program and the earnings, gains
  and losses thereon to the same extent he is vested in his
  Employer Leveraged ESOP Account under the Profit Sharing Program. 
  All other amounts credited to a Participant's McCAP II Account
  and the earnings thereon shall be fully vested.

     2.8  Payment of Benefits.  Distributions of the McCAP II
  Account of a Participant who has not made a Delinking Election,
  as provided in Section 2.10(a) or 2.10(b), shall be made as
  follows:

           (a)  McDESOP Portion of McCAP II Account.  The portion
      of a Participant's McCAP II Account which in the absence of
      the Limits would have been benefits provided by the McDESOP
      portion of the Profit Sharing Program shall be paid to him in
      cash at the same time and in the same form (other than in the
      form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company) that
      his account under the McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing
      Program is paid or commences to be paid.

           (b)  Profit Sharing Plan Portion of McCAP II Account. 
      The portion of a Participant's McCAP II Account which in the
      absence of the Limits would have been benefits provided by
      the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program
      shall be paid to the Participant in cash at the same time and
      in the same form (other than in the form of an annuity
      purchased from an insurance company) that his account under
      the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program
      is paid or commences to be paid.

           (c)  Leveraged ESOP Portion of McCAP II Account.  The
      portion of a Participant's McCap II Account which in the
      absence of the Limits would have been benefits provided by
      the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program
      shall be paid to him in cash at the same time and in the same
      form (other than in the form of an annuity contract purchased
      from an insurance company) that benefits are paid under the
      Leveraged ESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program.

           (d)  Annuity Elections.  A participant in the Profit
      Sharing Program who elects to receive his accounts under the
      Profit Sharing Program in the form of an annuity shall
      receive payment of the same portions of his McCap II Accounts
      in installment payments over a period certain equal to the
      joint and last survivor life expectancy of the Participant
      and his beneficiary, if any, at the time that the annuity is
      purchased under the Profit Sharing Program.

           (e)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order. 
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made
      in accordance with Sections 2.8(a), 2.8(b) or 2.8(c) on
      account of the payment, under the Profit Sharing Program, of
      a distribution from the account of a participant who is, at
      the time of distribution, an active McDonald's employee, nor
      shall a distribution be made on account of a distribution
      made from the Profit Sharing Program in accordance with a
      qualified domestic relations order except as provided in
      Section 3.8.

           (f)  Transaction Costs.  To the extent that the amounts
      described in Section 2.3(b) are used by the Participant or
      former employee to purchase shares of McDonald's stock on the
      open market in one or more transactions within seven months
      after the date such amounts were distributed, the Company
      shall reimburse such Participant or former employee for all
      reasonable brokerage fees and other transaction costs
      incurred by him in connection with such purchases upon
      presentation to the Company not later than 60 days after the
      date of each transaction or satisfactory evidence thereof.

     2.9   Beneficiary Designation.  Absent a Beneficiary Delinking
  Election by a Participant under Section 2.10(c):  

           (a)  A Participant's McCap II Profit Sharing Account
      shall be paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his
      Profit Sharing Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in
      the same form and same time as distributions are made
      thereunder.

           (b)  A Participant's McCap II McDESOP Account shall be
      paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his McDESOP
      Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in the same form
      and same time as distributions are made thereunder.

           (c)  A Participant's McCap II Leveraged ESOP Account
      shall be paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his
      Leveraged ESOP Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in
      the same form and the same time as distributions are made
      thereunder.

     2.10  Delinking Election.  Distributions of McCap II Accounts
  pursuant to a Delinking Election, as provided in Sections 2.10(b)
  or 2.10(d), (the "Delinking Election") shall be made in
  accordance with this Section 2.10 rather than Section 2.8.  A
  Participant's Delinking Election shall be irrevocable except to
  the extent provided in this Section 2.10.

           (a)  Active Employees.  Each Participant who has made a
      Delinking Election as to distributions to be made in his
      lifetime, as provided herein, shall receive distributions
      after he has a Termination of Employment and during his life
      in accordance with this Section 2.10(a) ("Lifetime Delinking
      Election").

                (1)  Time of Lifetime Delinking Election.  A
           Participant who is an active employee on or after
           September 20, 1995, may make a Lifetime Delinking
           Election or a revised Lifetime Delinking Election to
           change the form or timing of distributions under his
           Lifetime Delinking Election at any time.

                (2)  Complete Election.  Each Lifetime Delinking
           Election shall designate the date on which the
           Participant's account balances are to be paid or
           commence to be paid and shall select whether payments
           are to be made in the form of a single sum payment or in
           installments.  Installments may be paid monthly,
           quarterly or annually over a period designated in the
           Lifetime Delinking Election by the Participant which
           period which shall not exceed the period specified in
           Section 2.11(b).  A Lifetime Delinking Election shall
           not be effective unless it is complete and includes an
           election as to the timing and form of the distribution
           or distributions.

                (3)  Distribution Election.  Each Participant who
           is an active employee and who has made a Lifetime
           Delinking Election shall be permitted to make a new
           Lifetime Delinking Election changing his elections as to
           the timing and form of his distribution.  Each such
           Lifetime Delinking Election which is made before
           October 31, or such earlier date as the Committee shall
           designate by giving notice to Participants, shall become
           effective the next January 1 and shall remain effective
           through at least December 31 of such year.  In the
           absence of a new Lifetime Delinking Election, the
           Participant's prior Lifetime Delinking Election shall
           stay in effect from year to year.  The Lifetime
           Delinking Election of a Participant who has a
           Termination of Employment shall become irrevocable.

                (4)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order.  No
           distributions shall be made in accordance with Section
           2.10 on account of the payment, under the Profit Sharing
           Program, of a distribution from the McCAP II Account of
           a Participant who is, at the time of distribution, an
           active McDonald's employee, nor shall such a
           distribution be made on account of a distribution made
           from the Profit Sharing Program in accordance with a
           qualified domestic relations order except as provided in
           Section 3.8.

           (b)  Former Employees.  Each Participant who was a
      former employee on September 20, 1995, may make a Lifetime
      Delinking Election or a Beneficiary Delinking Election,
      before October 31, 1995, with respect to his McCap I, McCAP
      II and McEqual account balances available for distribution
      after December 31, 1995.  Such a Lifetime Delinking Election
      shall be irrevocable in all respects and shall designate both
      the form in which the distributions are to be made (a single
      sum distribution or monthly, quarterly or yearly installments
      paid over a period not to exceed the period specified in
      Section 2.11(b)), and the date on which distributions will be
      made, if in a single sum, or commence to be made, if in
      installments.  Under a Beneficiary Delinking Election, the
      former employee's beneficiary designation under the Profit
      Sharing Program shall no longer apply to designate his
      beneficiary under McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP II and he shall
      complete a separate beneficiary designation which shall not
      name different beneficiaries to receive the Profit Sharing,
      McDESOP, leveraged ESOP and Stock Sharing portions of the
      McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP II.  Except as provided in this
      Section 2.10(b), Lifetime Delinking Elections or Beneficiary
      Delinking Elections shall not be made by former employees.  

           (c)  Beneficiary Delinking Election.  Effective on July
      1, 1996 or at such earlier date as the Committee designates,
      each Participant who is an active employee may make an
      election to delink his beneficiary designation under the
      Plan, McEqual or McCAP I (a "Beneficiary Delinking Election")
      and may elect to designate beneficiaries to receive his
      McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP II Accounts which may or may not
      be different persons than the beneficiaries designated to
      receive his Net Balance Accounts under the Profit Sharing
      Program.  Under a Beneficiary Delinking Election, a
      Participant shall not name different beneficiaries to receive
      the Profit Sharing, McDESOP, Leveraged ESOP and Stock Sharing
      portions of the Plan, McEqual and McCAP I.  However, several
      beneficiaries can be designated to receive a proportion of
      the total of such benefits.

           (d)  Beneficiary's Elections.  Each beneficiary of a
      deceased Participant who before his death made a Beneficiary
      Delinking Election and each beneficiary who is the
      beneficiary of a Participant who died before September 20,
      1995, shall have a one time opportunity to make an election
      designating the form (a single sum distribution or monthly,
      quarterly or yearly installments) and the date on which
      distributions will be made, if in a single sum, or commence
      to be made, if in installments (a "Form of Payment Delinking
      Election") as follows:

                (1)  The beneficiary of a former employee who died
           before September 20, 1995, must make his Form of Payment
           Delinking Election hereunder not later than October 31,
           1995 and such election shall be made with respect to
           amounts which otherwise would not be paid until after
           December 31, 1995.  If such a beneficiary does not make
           a Delinking Election, distributions shall be made as
           provided in Section 2.8.

                (2)  The beneficiary of a deceased Participant who
           had made a Beneficiary Delinking Election before his
           death shall make a Form of Payment Delinking Election
           within 183 days of the date of such Participant's death. 
           Whether or not such a beneficiary makes a Delinking
           Election, distributions to such a beneficiary shall not
           commence any earlier than 90 days after the one year
           anniversary of the Participant's death.  Distributions
           made to such a beneficiary in the form of installments
           shall be made over a period, not to exceed the period
           specified in Section 2.11(b).  If the beneficiary of a
           deceased Participant, who had made a Beneficiary
           Delinking Election before his death, does not make a
           Form of Payment Delinking Election, his account balances
           shall be distributed in a single sum no sooner than the
           90th day after the first anniversary of the
           Participant's death.

                The beneficiary of a Participant's beneficiary who
           was subject to a Beneficiary Delinking Election shall
           receive his benefits in a single sum payment as soon as
           administratively feasible after the Valuation Date
           immediately following the beneficiary's death and the
           administrative determination of the identity of such
           beneficiary's beneficiary.

                (3)  If a deceased Participant who has made a
           Delinking Election fails to designate a beneficiary or
           designates as beneficiary an individual who predeceases
           the Participant or an entity which ceases to exist
           before the Participant's death, the Participant's
           beneficiary for purposes of the Plan shall be his
           Beneficiary as designated in the Profit Sharing Plan.

     2.11  Installment Payments.

           (a)  Order of Payment of Accounts.  Installment
      distributions under a Delinking Election made pursuant to
      Section 2.10 shall be paid:

                (1)  first, from the Participant's or beneficiary's
           leveraged ESOP account under McEqual, McCAP I and
           McCAP II, in that order;

                (2)  second, from the Participant's or
           beneficiary's McDESOP account under McEqual, McCAP I and
           McCAP II, in that order; and

                (3)  last, from the Participant's or beneficiary's
           Profit Sharing account under McEqual, McCAP I and
           McCAP II in that order.

           (b)  Maximum Period of Payment.  Participants or
      Beneficiaries electing to receive installment payments may
      elect to receive substantially equal payments over a fixed
      period of not more than 25 years or payments in a fixed
      dollar amount which shall not be less than the amount which
      at the time the election is made would be expected, assuming
      no interest and no mortality, to result in the payment of the
      Participants' accounts under McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP II in
      a period not in excess of 25 years.

     2.12  Limitation on Elections and Payments.  Notwithstanding
  any other provision of this Section 2:

           (a)  no investment election or other election which is
      permitted hereunder to be made by any individual who is an
      officer or director of the Company for the purposes of
      Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
      (the "Act"), shall be effective before the first date that
      such election could be made effective without being
      considered a nonexempt purchase or sale under Section 16(b)
      of the Act, and

           (b)  no distribution from the Plan shall be made
      hereunder to any person who, at the time of distribution, is,
      or within the immediately preceding six months was, an
      officer or director of the Company for purposes of Section 16
      of the Act before the first date that such distribution would
      not be a nonexempt purchase or sale under Section 16(b) of
      the Act.

     2.13  Valuation of Accounts.  The value of any portion of a
  Participant's McCap II Profit Sharing Account to be paid in cash
  shall be valued as of the Valuation Date, as defined in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program, preceding the date of payment,
  based upon the value of the Investment Funds under the Profit
  Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program.  The value of
  any portion of a Participant's McCap II McDonald's Common Stock
  Account to be paid in cash shall be valued as of the Valuation
  Date, preceding the date of payment, using the same values of
  McDonald's Common Stock determined for the Profit Sharing
  McDonald's Common Stock Fund.

     2.14  Funding.  Benefits payable under the Plan to any person
  shall be paid directly by the Company or other adopting employer
  (collectively called "Employers") which employs such person.  The
  Employers shall not be required to fund, or otherwise segregate
  assets to be used for payment of benefits under the Plan.  While
  the Employers may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors,
  make investments (a) in shares of McDonald's common stock through
  open market purchases or (b) in other investments in amounts
  equal or unequal to amounts payable hereunder, the Employers
  shall not be under any obligation to make such investments and
  any such investment shall remain an asset of the contributing
  Employer subject to the claims of its general creditors. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employers, in the discretion
  of the Company, may maintain one or more trusts to hold assets to
  be used for payment of benefits under the Plan; provided that the
  assets of such trust shall be subject to the creditors of the
  contributing Employer in an amount equal to the amount held in
  the trust multiplied by the percentage of all McCAP II Account
  balances which represent amounts credited to Participants on
  account of their being employees of such Employer in the event
  such Employer becomes insolvent or is subject to bankruptcy or
  insolvency proceedings.  Any payments by such a trust of benefits
  provided to a Participant under the Plan shall be considered
  payment by the Participant's Employer and shall discharge such
  Employer of any further liability for the payments made by such
  trust.


                              Section 3

                            Miscellaneous

     3.1  Plan Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by
  the Committee responsible for administration of the Profit
  Sharing Program ("Committee").  The Committee shall have, to the
  extent appropriate, the same powers, rights, duties and
  obligations with respect to the Plan as it has with respect to
  the Profit Sharing Program.

     3.2  Employment Rights.  Establishment of the Plan shall not
  be construed to give any employee the right to be retained in the
  Company's service or to any benefits not specifically provided by
  the Plan, nor shall the establishment of the Plan in any manner
  modify the Company's right to modify, amend or terminate the
  Profit Sharing Program, McEqual or McCAP I.

     3.3  Interests Not Transferable.  Except as to withholding of
  any tax under the laws of the United States or any state or
  locality or as provided in Section 3.8, no benefit payable at any
  time under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation,
  sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, or other legal
  process, or encumbrance of any kind.  Any attempt to alienate,
  sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such
  benefits, whether currently or thereafter payable, shall be void. 
  No benefit shall, in any manner, be liable for or subject to the
  debts or liabilities of any person entitled to such benefits.  If
  any person shall attempt to, or shall alienate, sell, transfer,
  assign, pledge or otherwise encumber his benefits under the Plan,
  or if by reason of his bankruptcy or other event happening at any
  time, such benefits would devolve upon any other person or would
  not be enjoyed by the person entitled thereto under the Plan,
  then the Company, in its discretion, may terminate the interest
  in any such benefits of the person entitled thereto under the
  Plan and hold or apply them to or for the benefit of such person
  entitled thereto under the Plan or his spouse, children or other
  dependents, or any of them, in such manner as the Company may
  deem proper.

     3.4  Unclaimed Amounts.  Unclaimed amounts shall consist of
  the amounts of the McCAP II Accounts of a Participant which
  cannot be distributed because of the Committee's inability, after
  a reasonable search, to locate the Participant or his beneficiary
  within a period of two (2) years after the payment of benefits
  becomes due.  Unclaimed amounts shall be forfeited at the end of
  such two-year period.  These forfeitures will reduce the
  obligations of the Company under the Plan.  After an unclaimed
  amount has been forfeited, the Participant or beneficiary, as
  applicable, shall have no further right to his McCAP II Account.

     3.5  Controlling Law.  The law of Illinois, except its law
  with respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all
  matters relating to the Plan to the extent not preempted by
  ERISA.

     3.6  Gender and Number.  Words in the masculine gender shall
  include the feminine, and the plural shall include the singular
  and the singular shall include the plural.

     3.7  Action by the Company.  Except as otherwise specifically
  provided herein, any action required of or permitted by the
  Company under the Plan shall be by resolution of the Board of
  Directors of McDonald's Corporation or any member of the
  Committee or person(s) authorized by resolution of the Board of
  Directors of McDonald's Corporation.

      3.8  Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

           (a)  Notwithstanding Section 3.3, the Committee shall
      comply with the provisions of any order determined by the
      Committee to be a Qualified Relations Order.

           (b)  "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" means any
      judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property
      settlement agreement):

                (1)  which is made pursuant to a state domestic
           relations law (including a community property law);

                (2)  which relates to the provision of child
           support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to
           a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a
           Participant;

                (3)  which creates or recognizes the existence of
           an alternate payee's right to or assigns to an alternate
           payee the right to receive all or a portion of the
           Participant's Accrued Benefit under the Plan; and

                (4)  with respect to which the requirements of
           paragraphs (c) and (d) are met.

           (c)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified
      Domestic Relations Order only if such order clearly
      specifies:

                (1)  the name and the last known mailing address,
           if any, of the Participant and the name and mailing
           address of each alternate payee covered by the order;

                (2)  the amount or percentage of the Participant's
           Accrued Benefit to be paid by the Plan to each such
           alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or
           percentage is to be determined;

                (3)  the number of payments or period to which such
           order applies; and

                (4)  each plan to which such order applies.

           (d)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified
      Domestic Relations Order only if such order does not

                (1)  require the Plan to provide any type or form
           of benefit, or any option not otherwise provided under
           the Plan;

                (2)  require the Plan to provide increased benefits
           (determined on the basis of actuarial value); or

                (3)  require the payment of benefits to an
           alternate payee which are required to be paid to another
           alternate payee under another order previously
           determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

           (e)  In the case of any payment before a Participant has
      had a termination of employment, a domestic relations order
      shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of
      Section 3.8(d)(l) solely because such order requires that
      payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee:

                (1)  without regard to the Participant's attainment
           of any specified age;

                (2)  as if the Participant had retired on the date
           on which such payment is to begin under such order; and

                (3)  in any form in which such benefits may be paid
           under the Plan to the Participant.


                              Section 4

                      Subsidiary Participation

     4.1  Adoption of Plan.  Any Commonly Controlled Entity,
  Commonly Controlled Corporation, Domestic Affiliate or Foreign
  Affiliate, as defined in the Profit Sharing Program, which has
  adopted a portion of the Profit Sharing Program may, with the
  approval of the Committee and under such terms and conditions as
  the Committee may prescribe, adopt the corresponding portions of
  the Plan by resolution of its board of directors.

     4.2  Withdrawal from the Plan by Participating Employer. 
  While it is not the present intention of any adopting employer to
  withdraw from the Plan, any such employer other than the Company
  shall have the right, at any time, upon the approval of and under
  such conditions as may be provided by the Committee, to withdraw
  from the Plan by delivering to the Committee written notice of
  its election so to withdraw.

      Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the McCAP II
  Accounts of Participants employed by the withdrawing employer as
  of the date of withdrawal shall be distributed by such employer
  in cash at such time or times as the Committee, in its sole
  discretion, may deem to be in the best interest of such
  Participants or their beneficiaries.

                              Section 5

                      Amendment and Termination

      The Company intends the Plan to be permanent, but reserves
  the right at any time by action of its Board of Directors or by 
  the Committee (in accordance with the restrictions in the
  following paragraph ) to modify, amend or terminate the Plan,
  notwithstanding that an amendment may change the timing or the
  optional form of benefit elected by a Participant in a Delinking
  Election or the timing or optional form of benefit in which a
  Participant's benefits would otherwise have been paid under
  Section 2, provided, however, that if a Participant has a
  McCAP II Account, benefits provided under Section 2.1 shall
  constitute an irrevocable obligation of the employer to the same
  extent that such McCAP II Account, had it been an account under
  the Profit Sharing Program, would have been an irrevocable
  obligation of the Profit Sharing Program.

      The Committee shall have the same authority with respect to
  the adoption of amendments to the Plan as the Board of Directors
  in the following circumstances:

           (a)  to adopt amendments to the Plan which the Committee
           determines are necessary or desirable for the Plan to
           comply with or to obtain benefits or advantages under
           the provisions of applicable law, regulations or rulings
           or requirements of the Internal Revenue Service or other
           governmental administrative agency or changes in such
           law, regulations, rulings or requirements; and

           (b)  to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic amendment
           that the Committee determines to be necessary or
           desirable that does not materially change benefits to
           Participants or their beneficiaries or materially
           increase the Company's or adopting employers'
           contributions to the Plan.

      The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by
  the Committee to the Board of Directors on a timely basis.

      Executed in multiple originals this 18th day of December, 1995.

                                 McDONALD's

                  PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM EQUALIZATION PLAN

                                 ("McEQUAL")


                                  McDONALD's

                  PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM EQUALIZATION PLAN

                                 ("McEQUAL")



                                  Section 1

                                Introduction

      1.1   The Plan and Its Effective Date.  The McDonald's Profit
  Sharing Program Equalization Plan (the "Plan" or "McEqual"), was
  established effective January 1, 1989, by the merger, amendment
  and restatement of the McDonald's Supplemental Employee Benefit
  Equalization Plan, established effective January 1, 1983,
  approved by the shareholders on May 19, 1983, and amended and
  restated effective January 1, 1987, and the McDESOP Equalization
  Plan, established effective January 1, 1986, approved by the
  shareholders on May 23, 1986, and amended and restated effective
  January 1, 1987.  The Plan which was further amended and restated
  effective January 1, 1989, and January 1, 1990 is hereby amended
  and restated effective January 1, 1996, except as otherwise
  provided herein.

      1.2   Purpose.  McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's" or the
  "Company") maintains the McDonald's Corporation Profit Sharing
  Program ("Profit Sharing Program") which has four components, the
  Profit Sharing Plan, McDESOP, the Leveraged ESOP and the
  McDonald's Stock Sharing Plan which are intended to meet the
  requirements of a qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code
  of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  While Code Section 415 places
  limitations on the maximum amount of contributions and benefits
  which may be paid under a qualified plan ("Limits"), the Employee
  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
  permits the payment under an "excess benefit plan" of the
  benefits which may not be paid under a qualified plan because of
  such Limits.  The purpose of the Plan is to provide benefits
  which would be provided under the Profit Sharing Program, as
  presently in effect and as hereafter from time to time amended,
  but which are not provided thereunder because of the Limits.  In
  determining the amounts to be credited to an Active Participant's
  accounts during a Plan Year under the Plan, the Profit Sharing
  Program, the McDonald's 1989 Executive Equalization Plan
  ("McCAP I") and the McDonald's Supplemental Employee Benefit
  Equalization Plan ("McCAP II"), the Committee may make
  assumptions based upon reasonable estimates and, as necessary,
  make subsequent adjustments to the extent the estimates prove to
  be incorrect.

      1.3   Defined Terms.  Except as otherwise indicated
  capitalized terms used in this plan document which are not
  defined herein have the same meaning as the same term in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program.

                              Section 2

                     Participation and Benefits

      2.1   Eligibility for and Amount of Benefits.  Subject to the
  conditions and limitations of the Plan, if for any year an
  employee of the Company or any other entity which has adopted the 
  Plan in accordance with Section 4 who is a participant in the
  Profit Sharing Program has the amount of employer contributions
  (including Participant Elected Contributions) and forfeitures
  which would have been allocated to his accounts under the Profit
  Sharing Program reduced pursuant to the Limits as stated in
  Article IX thereof, the amount of each such reduction shall be
  credited to such employee's "McEqual Account" hereunder ("Annual
  Benefit Credits") and he shall be an active participant for such
  year ("Active Participant").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
  amount distributed to a participant in the Profit Sharing Program
  in accordance with Sections 4.1(c), 5.2(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4 of the
  Profit Sharing Program shall be considered an amount which was
  received under the Profit Sharing Program in the calendar year
  for which the amount was contributed to the Profit Sharing
  Program (or would have been so contributed in the absence of the
  Limits).  A person who was a participant in the McDonald's
  Supplemental Employee Benefit Equalization Plan or the McDESOP
  Equalization Plan before January 1, 1989 or who becomes an Active
  Participant thereafter shall remain a participant ("Participant")
  with respect to amounts credited to his McEqual Account until the
  amounts credited to his McEqual Account have been distributed.

      2.2   Income Credits.  Amounts credited to a Participant's
  McEqual Account for periods before January 1, 1996 shall be
  credited to Participant's McEqual Accounts as provided by the
  Plan as then in effect.  Such amounts and amounts credited to a
  Participant's McEqual Account with respect to periods after
  December 31, 1995 shall be credited with earnings, gains and
  losses as described below:

            (a)  McEqual Profit Sharing Investment Account.  The
       portion of a Participant's Annual Benefit Credits which in
       the absence of the Limits would have been Employer Profit
       Sharing Contributions to the Profit Sharing portion of the
       Profit Sharing Program shall be credited to the
       Participant's McEqual Profit Sharing Investment Account for
       a calendar year.  A Participant's McEqual Profit Sharing
       Investment Account shall also be credited with any amounts
       with respect to which a Participant has made a
       Diversification Election, as provided in Section 2.3 and any
       amounts subject to any election made by the Participant
       pursuant to Section 2.4.  A Participant's McEqual Profit
       Sharing Investment Account shall be credited with net
       earnings, gains and losses as of the Valuation Date under
       the Profit Sharing Program in an amount equal to the amount
       which such account would have earned, gained or lost if at
       all times such amounts and the income credited thereon were
       fully invested in the same manner as the Participant's
       Employer Profit Sharing Contribution Account under the
       Profit Sharing Program.

            (b)  McEqual McDonald's Common Stock Account.  Subject
       to Section 2.3, the portion of a Participant's Annual
       Benefit Credits which, in the absence of the Limits, would
       have been credited to such Active Participant's accounts
       under the Profit Sharing Program with respect to Participant
       Elected Contributions, Employer Matching Contributions and
       Employer Leveraged ESOP Contributions shall be credited to
       the Participant's McEqual McDonald's Common Stock Account
       for a calendar year.  A Participant's McEqual McDonald's
       Common Stock Account shall be credited with net earnings,
       gains and losses as of each Valuation Date under the Profit
       Sharing Program in an amount equal to the amount which such
       account would have earned, gained or lost if such amounts
       and the income credited thereon were at all times fully
       invested in the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund.

      2.3   Diversification of Investments.  If a Participant makes
  a Diversification Election in accordance with the provisions of
  Section 10.10 of the Profit Sharing Program (the "Diversification
  Election"), his corresponding McEqual accounts and subaccounts
  containing the contributions and income with respect thereto
  which, if not for the Limits, would have been credited to his
  accounts under the McDESOP or the Leveraged ESOP portions of the
  Profit Sharing Program shall to the same extent be credited to
  the Participant's McEqual Profit Sharing Account and shall
  thereafter be credited with income as provided in Section 2.2(a).

      2.4   Transfers to the Profit Sharing Investment Account.  A
  Participant may make an irrevocable election to have all amounts
  which have been credited to his McEqual McDonald's Common Stock
  Account through March 31, 1991, which represent amounts which
  except for the Limits would have been credited to the Profit
  Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program and any
  accumulated income credited thereon, credited with earnings,
  gains and losses as of each Valuation Date, as defined in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program, equal to the amount which such
  credited amounts would have earned, gained or lost if at all
  times after the effective date of such election such amounts and
  the income credited thereon had been fully invested in the
  McEqual Profit Sharing Investment Account.  Any election made
  pursuant to this Section shall be completed, delivered to the
  Committee and made effective in such manner and at such time as
  the Committee shall determine in accordance with its rules
  concerning the manner of making investment elections under the
  Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program.

      2.5   Vesting.  A Participant shall be vested in the portion
  of his McEqual Account which in the absence of the Limits would
  have been allocated to his Profit Sharing Account under the
  Profit Sharing Program and the earnings, gains or losses thereon
  to the same extent he is vested in his Profit Sharing Account
  under the Profit Sharing Program.  A Participant shall be vested
  in the portions of his McEqual Account which in the absence of
  the Limits would have been allocated to his Leveraged ESOP
  Account under the Profit Sharing Program and the earnings, gains
  or losses thereon to the same extent that he would have been
  vested in his Employer Leveraged ESOP Account under the Profit
  Sharing Program.  All other amounts credited to a Participant's
  McEqual Account and the earnings thereon shall be fully vested.

      2.6   Payment of Benefits.  Distributions of the McEqual
  Account of a Participant who has not made a Delinking Election,
  as provided in Section 2.8, shall be made as follows:

            (a)  McDESOP Portion of McEqual Account.  The portion
       of a Participant's McEqual Account which in the absence of
       the Limits would have been benefits provided by the McDESOP
       portion of the Profit Sharing Program shall be paid to him
       in cash at the same time and in the same form (other than in
       the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company)
       that his account under the McDESOP portion of the Profit
       Sharing Program is paid or commences to be paid.

            (b)  Profit Sharing Plan Portion of McEqual Account. 
       The portion of a Participant's McEqual Account which in the
       absence of the Limits would have been benefits provided by
       the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing
       Program shall be paid to the Participant in cash at the same
       time and in the same form (other than in the form of an
       annuity purchased from an insurance company) that his
       accounts under the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit
       Sharing Program are paid or commence to be paid. 

            (c)  Leveraged ESOP Portion of McEqual Account.  The
       portion of a Participant's McEqual Account which in the
       absence of the Limits would have been benefits provided by
       the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program
       shall be paid to him in cash at the same time and in the
       same form (other than in the form of an annuity contract
       purchased from an insurance company) that benefits are paid
       under the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Profit Sharing
       Program.

            (d)  Annuity Elections.  A participant in the Profit
       Sharing Program who elects to receive his accounts under the
       Profit Sharing Program in the form of an annuity shall
       receive payment of the same portions of his McEqual Accounts
       in installment payments over a period certain equal to the
       joint and last survivor life expectancy of the Participant
       and his beneficiary, if any, at the time that the annuity is
       purchased under the Profit Sharing Program.

            (e)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order. 
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution shall be made
       in accordance with Sections 2.6(a), 2.6(b) or 2.6(c) on
       account of the payment, under the Profit Sharing Program, of
       a distribution from the account of a participant who is, at
       the time of distribution, an active McDonald's employee, nor
       shall such a distribution be made on account of a
       distribution made from the Profit Sharing Program in
       accordance with a qualified domestic relations order except
       as provided in Section 3.8.

      2.7   Beneficiary Designation.  Absent a Beneficiary
  Delinking Election by a Participant under Section 2.8(c):

            (a)  A Participant's McEqual Profit Sharing Account
       shall be paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his
       Profit Sharing Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in
       the same form and same time as distributions are made
       thereunder.

            (b)  A Participant's McEqual McDESOP Account shall be
       paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his McDESOP
       Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in the same form
     and same time as distributions are made thereunder.

          (c)  A Participant's McEqual Leveraged ESOP Account
     shall be paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his
     Leveraged ESOP Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in
     the same form and the same time as distributions are made
     thereunder.

     If a beneficiary who is entitled to do so does not make a
  Delinking Election as provided in Section 2.8(d), the
  distribution of his accounts shall be made as provided in this
  Section 2.7 beginning no earlier than the applicable date
  provided in Section 2.8(d).

      2.8   Delinking Election.  Delinking elections shall only be
  made by Participants who are on the McDonald's Executive Payroll
  and the beneficiaries of such Participant as permitted below. 
  Distributions of McEqual Accounts pursuant to a Delinking
  Election, as provided in Section 2.8(b) or 2.8(d), (the
  "Delinking Election") shall be made in accordance with this
  Section 2.8 rather than Section 2.6.  A Participant's Delinking
  Election shall be irrevocable except to the extent provided in
  this Section 2.8.

            (a)  Active Employees.  Each Participant who has made a
       Delinking Election as to distributions to be made in his
       lifetime, as provided herein, shall receive distributions
       after he has a Termination of Employment and during his life
       in accordance with this Section 2.8(a) ("Lifetime Delinking
       Election").  

                 (1)  Time of Lifetime Delinking Election.  A
            Participant who is an active employee on or after
            September 1, 1995, may make a Lifetime Delinking
            Election or a revised Lifetime Delinking Election to
            change the form or timing of distributions under his
            Lifetime Delinking Election at any time.      

                 (2)  Complete Election.  Each Lifetime Delinking
            Election shall designate the date on which the
            Participant's account balances are to be paid or
            commence to be paid and shall select whether payments
            are to be made in the form of a single sum payment or
            in installments.  Installments may be paid monthly,
            quarterly or annually over a period designated in the
            Lifetime Delinking Election by the Participant which
            period which shall not exceed the period specified in
            Section 2.9(b).  A Lifetime Delinking Election shall
            not be effective unless it is complete and includes an
            election as to the timing and form of the distribution
            or distributions.

                 (3)  Distribution Election.  Each Participant who
            is an active employee and who has made a Lifetime
            Delinking Election shall be permitted to make a new
            Lifetime Delinking Election changing his elections as
            to the timing and form of his distribution.  Each such
            Lifetime Delinking Election which is made before
            October 31, or such earlier date as the Committee shall
            designate by giving notice to Participants, shall be
            effective the next January 1 and shall remain effective
            through at least December 31 of such year.  In the
            absence of a new Lifetime Delinking Election the
            Participant's prior Lifetime Delinking Election shall
            stay in effect from year to year.  The Lifetime
            Delinking Election of a Participant who has a
            Termination of Employment shall become irrevocable.

                 (4)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order.  No
            distributions shall be made in accordance with Section
            2.9 on account of the payment, under the Profit Sharing
            Program, of a distribution from the McEqual Account of
            a Participant who is, at the time of distribution, an
            active McDonald's employee, nor shall such a
            distribution be made on account of a distribution made
            from the Profit Sharing Program in accordance with a
            qualified domestic relations order except as provided
            in Section 3.8.

            (b)  Former Employees.  Each Participant who was a
       former employee on September 20, 1995, may make a Lifetime
       Delinking Election or a Beneficiary Delinking Election, on
       or before October 31, 1995, with respect to his McEqual,
       McCAP I and McCAP II account balances available for
       distribution after December 31, 1995.  Such a Lifetime
       Delinking Election shall be irrevocable in all respects and
       shall designate both the form in which the distributions are
       to be made (a single sum distribution or monthly, quarterly
       or yearly installments paid over a period not to exceed the
       period specified in Section 2.9(b), and the date on which
       distributions will be made, if in a single sum, or commence
       to be made, if in installments.  Under a Beneficiary
       Delinking Election, the former employee's beneficiary
       designation under the Profit Sharing Program shall no longer
       apply to designate his beneficiary under McEqual, McCAP I
       and McCAP II and he shall complete a separate beneficiary
       designation which shall not name different beneficiaries to
       receive the Profit Sharing, McDESOP, leveraged ESOP and
       Stock Sharing portions of McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP II. 
       Except as provided in this Section 2.8(b), Lifetime
       Delinking Elections or Beneficiary Delinking Elections shall
       not be made by former employees.  

            (c)  Beneficiary Delinking Election.  Effective on July
       1, 1996 or at such earlier date as the Committee designates,
       each Participant who is an active employee may make an
       election to delink his beneficiary designation under the
       Plan, McCAP I and McCAP II (a "Beneficiary Delinking
       Election") may elect to designate beneficiaries to receive
       his McEqual Accounts which may or may not be different
       persons than the beneficiaries designated to receive his Net
       Balance Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program.  Under a
       Beneficiary Delinking Election, a Participant shall not name
       different beneficiaries to receive the Profit Sharing,
       McDESOP, Leveraged ESOP and Stock Sharing portions of the
       Plan, McEqual and McCAP II.  However, several beneficiaries
       can be designated to receive a proportion of the total of
       such benefits.

            (d)  Beneficiary's Elections.  Each beneficiary of a
       deceased Participant who before his death made a Beneficiary
       Delinking Election and each beneficiary who is the
       beneficiary of a Participant who died before September 20,
       1995, shall have a one time opportunity to make an election
       designating the form (a single sum distribution or monthly,
       quarterly or yearly installments) and the date on which
       distributions will be made, if in a single sum, or commence
       to be made, if in installments (a "Form of Payment Delinking
       Election") as follows:

                 (1)  The beneficiary of a former employee who died
            before September 20, 1995, must make his Form of
            Payment Delinking Election hereunder not later than
            October 31, 1995 and such election shall be made with
            respect to amounts which otherwise would not be paid
            until after December 31, 1995.  If such a beneficiary
            does not make a Delinking Election, distributions shall
            be made as provided in Section 2.7.  

                 (2)  The beneficiary of a deceased Participant who
            had made a Beneficiary Delinking Election before his
            death shall make a Form of Payment Delinking Election
            within 183 days of the date of such Participant's
            death.  Whether or not such a beneficiary makes a Form
            of Payment Delinking Election, distributions to such a
            beneficiary shall not commence any earlier than 90 days
            after the one year anniversary of the Participant's
            death.  Distributions made to such a beneficiary in the
            form of installments shall be made over a period, not
            to exceed the period specified in Section 2.9(b).  If
            the beneficiary of a deceased Participant, who had made
            a Beneficiary Delinking Election before his death, does
            not make a Form of Payment Delinking Election, his
            account balances shall be distributed in a single sum
            no sooner than the 90th day after the first anniversary
            of the Participant's death.

                 The beneficiary of a Participant's beneficiary who
            was subject to a Bbeneficiary Delinking Election shall
            receive his benefit in a single sum payment as soon as
            administratively feasible after the Valuation Date
            immediately following the beneficiary's death and the
            administrative determination of the identity of such
            beneficiary's beneficiary.

                 (3)  If a deceased Participant who has made a
            Delinking Election fails to designate a beneficiary or
            designates as beneficiary an individual who predeceases
            the Participant or an entity which ceases to exist
            before the Participant's death, the Participant's
            beneficiary for purposes of the Plan shall be his
            Beneficiary as designated in the Profit Sharing Plan.

      2.9   Installment Payments.

            (a)  Order of Payment of Accounts.  Installment
       distributions under a Delinking Election made pursuant to
       Section 2.8 shall be paid:

                 (1)  first, from the Participant's or
            beneficiary's leveraged ESOP account under McEqual,
            McCAP I and McCAP II, in that order;

                 (2)  second, from the Participant's or
            beneficiary's McDESOP account under McEqual, McCAP I
            and McCAP II, in that order; and

                 (3)  last, from the Participant's or beneficiary's
            Profit Sharing account under McEqual, McCAP I and
            McCAP II in that order.

            (b)  Minimum Period of Payment.  Participants or
       Beneficiaries electing to receive installment payments may
       elect to receive substantially equal payments over a fixed
       period of not more than 25 years or payments in a fixed
       dollar amount which shall not be less than the amount which
       at the time the election is made would be expected, assuming
       no interest and no mortality, to result in the payment of
       the Participants' accounts under McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP
       II in a period not in excess of 25 years.

      2.10  Limitation on Elections and Payments.  Notwithstanding
  any other provision of this Section 2:

            (a)  no investment election or other election which is
       permitted hereunder to be made by any individual who is an
       officer or director of the Company for the purposes of
       Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
       amended (the "Act"), shall be effective before the first
       date that such election could be made effective without
       being considered a nonexempt purchase or sale under
       Section 16(b) of the Act, and

            (b)  no distribution from the Plan shall be made
       hereunder to any person who, at the time of distribution,
       is, or within the immediately preceding six months was, an
       officer or director of the Company for purposes of Section
       16 of the Act before the first date that such distribution
       would not be a nonexempt purchase or sale under Section
       16(b) of the Act.

      2.11  Valuation of Accounts.  The value of any portion of a
  Participant's McEqual Profit Sharing Account to be paid in cash
  shall be valued as of the Valuation Date, as defined in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program, preceding the date of payment,
  based upon the value of the Investment Funds under the Profit
  Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program.  The value of
  any portion of a Participant's McEqual McDonald's Common Stock
  Account to be paid in cash shall be valued as of the Valuation
  Date, preceding the date of payment, using the values of
  McDonald's Common Stock determined for the Profit Sharing
  McDonald's Common Stock Fund.

      2.12  Funding.  Benefits payable under the Plan to any person
  shall be paid directly by the Company or other adopting employer
  (collectively called "Employers") which employs such person.  The
  Employers shall not be required to fund, or otherwise segregate
  assets to be used for payment of benefits under the Plan.  While
  the Employers may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors,
  make investments (a) in shares of McDonald's common stock through
  open market purchases or (b) in other investments in amounts
  equal or unequal to amounts payable hereunder, the Employers
  shall not be under any obligation to make such investments and
  any such investment shall remain an asset of the contributing
  Employer subject to the claims of its general creditors. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employers, in the discretion
  of the Company, may maintain one or more trusts to hold assets to
  be used for payment of benefits under the Plan; provided that the
  assets of such trust shall be subject to the creditors of the
  contributing Employer in an amount equal to the amount held in
  the trust multiplied by the percentage of all McEqual account
  balances which represent amounts credited to Participants on
  account of their being employees of such Employer in the event
  such Employer becomes insolvent or is subject to bankruptcy or
  insolvency proceedings.  Any payments by such a trust of benefits
  provided to a Participant under the Plan shall be considered
  payment by the Participant's Employer and shall discharge such
  Employer of any further liability under the Plan for the payments
  made by such trust.


                              Section 3

                            Miscellaneous

      3.1   Plan Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by
  the Committee responsible for administration of the Profit
  Sharing Program ("Committee").  The Committee shall have, to the
  extent appropriate, the same powers, rights, duties and
  obligations with respect to the Plan as it has with respect to
  the Profit Sharing Program.

      3.2   Employment Rights.  Establishment of the Plan shall not
  be construed to give any Participant the right to be retained in
  the Company's service or to any benefits not specifically
  provided by the Plan, nor shall the establishment of the Plan in
  any manner modify the Company's right to modify, amend or
  terminate the Profit Sharing Program, McCAP I or McCAP II.

      3.3   Interests Not Transferable.  Except as to withholding
  of any tax under the laws of the United States or any state or
  locality or as provided in Section 3.8, no benefit payable at any
  time under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation,
  sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, or other legal
  process, or encumbrance of any kind.  Any attempt to alienate,
  sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such
  benefits, whether currently or thereafter payable, shall be void. 
  No benefit shall, in any manner, be liable for or subject to the
  debts or liabilities of any person entitled to such benefits.  If
  any person shall attempt to, or shall alienate, sell, transfer,
  assign, pledge or otherwise encumber his benefits under the Plan,
  or if by reason of his bankruptcy or other event happening at any
  time, such benefits would devolve upon any other person or would
  not be enjoyed by the person entitled thereto under the Plan,
  then the Company, in its discretion, may terminate the interest
  in any such benefits of the person entitled thereto under the
  Plan and hold or apply them to or for the benefit of such person
  entitled thereto under the Plan or his spouse, children or other
  dependents, or any of them, in such manner as the Company may
  deem proper.

      3.4   Unclaimed Amounts.  Unclaimed amounts shall consist of
  the amounts of the McEqual Accounts of a Participant which cannot
  be distributed because of the Committee's inability, after a
  reasonable search, to locate a Participant or his beneficiary
  within a period of two (2) years after the payment of benefits
  becomes due.  Unclaimed amounts shall be forfeited at the end of
  such two-year period.  These forfeitures will reduce the
  obligations of the Company under the Plan.  After an unclaimed
  amount has been forfeited, the Participant or beneficiary, as
  applicable, shall have no further right to his McEqual Account.

      3.5   Controlling Law.  The law of Illinois, except its law
  with respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all
  matters relating to the Plan to the extent not preempted by
  ERISA.

      3.6   Gender and Number.  Words in the masculine gender shall
  include the feminine, and the plural shall include the singular
  and the singular shall include the plural.

      3.7   Action by the Company.  Except as otherwise
  specifically provided herein, any action required of or permitted
  by the Company under the Plan shall be by resolution of the Board
  of Directors of McDonald's Corporation or any member of the
  Committee or person(s) authorized by resolution of the Board of
  Directors of McDonald's Corporation.

      3.8  Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

           (a)  Notwithstanding Section 3.3, the Committee shall
      comply with the provisions of any order determined by the
      Committee to be a Qualified Relations Order.

           (b)  "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" means any
      judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property
      settlement agreement):

                (1)  which is made pursuant to a state domestic
           relations law (including a community property law);

                (2)  which relates to the provision of child
           support, alimony payments, or marital property rights
           to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent
           of a Participant;

                (3)  which creates or recognizes the existence of
           an alternate payee's right to or assigns to an
           alternate payee the right to receive all or a portion
           of the Participant's Accrued Benefit under the Plan;
           and

                (4)  with respect to which the requirements of
           paragraphs (c) and (d) are met.

           (c)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified
      Domestic Relations Order only if such order clearly
      specifies:

                (1)  the name and the last known mailing address,
           if any, of the Participant and the name and mailing
           address of each alternate payee covered by the order;

                (2)  the amount or percentage of the Participant's
           Accrued Benefit to be paid by the Plan to each such
           alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or
           percentage is to be determined;

                (3)  the number of payments or period to which
           such order applies; and

                (4)  each plan to which such order applies.

           (d)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified
      Domestic Relations Order only if such order does not

                (1)  require the Plan to provide any type or form
           of benefit, or any option not otherwise provided under
           the Plan;

                (2)  require the Plan to provide increased
           benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value);
           or

                (3)  require the payment of benefits to an
           alternate payee which are required to be paid to
           another alternate payee under another order previously
           determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

           (e)  In the case of any payment before a Participant
      has had a termination of employment, a domestic relations
      order shall not be treated as failing to meet the
      requirements of Section 3.8(d)(l) solely because such order
      requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate
      payee:

                (1)  without regard to the Participant's
           attainment of any specified age;

                (2)  as if the Participant had retired on the date
           on which such payment is to begin under such order; and

                (3)  in any form in which such benefits may be
           paid under the Plan to the Participant.


                              Section 4

                      Subsidiary Participation

      4.1   Adoption of Plan.  Any Commonly Controlled Entity,
  Commonly Controlled Corporation, Domestic Affiliate or Foreign
  Affiliate, as defined in the Profit Sharing Program, which has
  adopted a portion of the Profit Sharing Program may, with the
  approval of the Committee and under such terms and conditions as
  the Committee may prescribe, adopt the corresponding portions of
  the Plan by resolution of its board of directors.

      4.2   Withdrawal from the Plan by Participating Employer. 
  While it is not the present intention of any adopting employer to
  withdraw from the Plan, any such employer other than the Company
  shall have the right, at any time, upon the approval of and under
  such conditions as may be provided by the Committee, to withdraw
  from the Plan by delivering to the Committee written notice of
  its election so to withdraw.

       Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the McEqual
  Accounts of Participants employed by the withdrawing employer as
  of the date of withdrawal shall be distributed by such employer
  in cash at such time or times as the Committee, in its sole
  discretion, may deem to be in the best interest of such
  Participants or their beneficiaries.

                              Section 5

                      Amendment and Termination

       The Company intends the Plan to be permanent, but reserves
  the right at any time by action of its Board of Directors or by
  the Committee (in accordance with the restrictions in the
  following paragraph) to modify, amend or terminate the Plan
  notwithstanding that an amendment may change the timing or the
  optional form of benefit elected by a Participant in a Delinking
  Election or the timing or optional form of benefit in which a
  Participant's benefits would otherwise have been paid under
  Section 2, provided, however, that if a Participant has a McEqual
  Account, benefits provided under Section 2.1 hereof shall
  constitute an irrevocable obligation of the employer to the same
  extent that such McEqual Account, had it been an account under
  the Profit Sharing Program, would have been an irrevocable
  obligation of the Profit Sharing Program.

       The Committee shall have the same authority with respect to
  the adoption of amendments to the Plan as the Board of Directors
  in the following circumstances:

            (a)  to adopt amendments to the Plan which the
       Committee determines are necessary or desirable for the Plan
       to comply with or to obtain benefits or advantages under the
       provisions of applicable law, regulations or rulings or
       requirements of the Internal Revenue Service or other
       governmental administrative agency or changes in such law,
       regulations, rulings or requirements; and

           (b)  to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic
       amendment that the Committee determines to be necessary or
       desirable that does not materially change benefits to
       Participants or their beneficiaries or materially increase
       the Company's or adopting employers' contributions to the
       Plan.

       The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by
  the Committee to the Board of Directors on a timely basis.

      Executed in multiple originals this 18th day of December, 1995.

                                McDONALD'S

                     1989 EXECUTIVE EQUALIZATION PLAN

                                ("McCAP I")
                                 McDONALD'S

                     1989 EXECUTIVE EQUALIZATION PLAN
                                ("McCAP I")


                                 Section 1

                               Introduction


     1.1  The Plan and Its Effective Date.  The McDonald's 1989
  Executive Equalization Plan (the "Plan" or "McCAP I") as
  established by McDonald's Corporation ("McDonald's" or the
  "Company") effective January 1, 1989, and amended and restated
  effective January 1, 1990, and as amended from time to time
  thereafter is hereby again amended and restated effective
  January 1, 1996 except as otherwise provided herein.

     1.2  Purpose.  The Company maintains the McDonald's
  Corporation Profit Sharing Program ("Profit Sharing Program")
  which has four components, the Profit Sharing Plan, McDESOP, the
  Leveraged ESOP and the McDonald's Stock Sharing Plan which are
  intended to meet the requirements of a qualified plan under
  Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
  (the "Code").  Code Section 402(g) generally limits to $9,500 (in
  1996, as adjusted in subsequent years for increases in the cost
  of living in accordance with Code Section 402(g)(5)) the maximum
  amount of employee elective deferrals under a qualified plan
  ("Elective Contribution Limit"); Code Section 401(a)(17) limits
  to $150,000 (in 1996, as adjusted in subsequent years as provided
  by the Secretary of the Treasury) the amount of compensation
  which may be taken into account for a Plan Year under a qualified
  plan ("Compensation Limit"); and elective deferrals to a
  nonqualified plan are not taken into account in determining
  compensation and benefits under the qualified plans ("Elective
  Deferral Exclusion") (such limits and exclusion are collectively
  referred to herein as the "Limits").

      However, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
  as amended ("ERISA"), permits the provision of benefits under an
  unfunded plan maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose
  of providing deferred compensation for a select group of
  management or highly compensated employees.  The purpose of the
  Plan is to provide benefits to eligible employees which would be
  provided under the Profit Sharing Program as in effect on
  January 1, 1989, and thereafter, as from time to time amended,
  but which are not provided thereunder because of the Limits,
  subject to the requirement that the benefits provided under this
  Plan shall be determined as though the only employee elected
  deferrals of an Active Participant, as defined in Section 2.1,
  are the Participant Elected Contributions elected under the
  McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program, the McDonald's
  Profit Sharing Program Equalization Plan ("McEqual"), the
  McDonald's Supplemental Employee Benefit Equalization Plan
  ("McCAP II"), and under Section 2.4 hereof.  In determining the
  amounts to be credited to the accounts of an Active Participant,
  during a calendar year under the Plan, McEqual, McCAP II, and the
  Profit Sharing Program, the Committee may make assumptions based
  upon reasonable estimates and, as necessary, make subsequent
  adjustments to the extent the estimates prove to be incorrect.

     1.3  Defined Terms.  Except as otherwise indicated capitalized
  terms used in this plan document which are not defined herein
  have the same meaning as the same term in the McDonald's Profit
  Sharing Program.


                              Section 2

                     Participation and Benefits


     2.1  Eligibility for Benefits.  Before the beginning of each
  calendar year, the Committee shall designate as eligible to be
  credited with benefits under the Plan for such calendar year
  employees of the Company or any other entity which has adopted
  the Plan in accordance with Section 4 who are at the pay level of
  director or higher or who are expected to earn $130,500 or more
  (in 1996, as adjusted in subsequent years for increases in the
  cost of living in such manner as the Committee shall determine)
  ("Active Participants").  Persons to be designated as Active
  Participants from the group of employees who first become
  participants in the Profit Sharing Program during a calendar year
  shall be designated by the Committee on or before their Profit
  Sharing Program Entry Date.  A person who becomes an Active
  Participant shall remain a participant ("Participant") until all
  amounts credited to his account under the Plan ("McCAP I
  Account") have been distributed.

      2.2  Amount of Benefits.  The amount credited to an Active
  Participant's McCAP I Account for a calendar year shall equal (a)
  the amount, if any, the Active Participant would have received
  under the Profit Sharing Program for that year (including, if the
  Active Participant pursuant to Section 2.4 so elects, the amount
  of any elections of Participant Elected Contributions made by the
  Active Participant and any associated Matching Contributions) in
  the absence of the limitations under Section 415 of the Code as
  stated in Article IX thereof ("415 Limits") and in the absence of
  the Limits reduced by (b) the sum of the amounts allocated to
  such Participant's accounts under the Profit Sharing Program and
  amounts credited to the Participant's account under McEqual for
  the calendar year ("Annual Benefit Credits").  Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, (1) any amount distributed to a participant in the
  Profit Sharing Program in accordance with Sections 4.1(c),
  5.2(c), 5.2(e) or 5.4 of the Program shall be considered an
  amount which was received under the Profit Sharing Program in the
  calendar year for which the amount was contributed to the Profit
  Sharing Program (or would have been so contributed in the absence
  of the Limits) and (2) an Active Participant who does not have an
  election in effect under Section 2.4 for a calendar year shall
  not be credited with any Participant Elected Contributions or
  Employer Matching Contributions hereunder for that calendar year.

      2.3  Accounts and Income Credits.  Except as otherwise
  provided herein, amounts credited to a Participant's McCAP I
  Account for periods before January 1, 1996 shall be credited to
  Participant's McCAP I Accounts as provided by the Plan as then in
  effect.  Such amounts and amounts credited to a Participant's
  McCAP I Account with respect to periods after December 31, 1995
  shall be credited with net earnings, gains and losses as
  described below:

           (a)  McCAP I Profit Sharing Investment Account.  The
      portion of a Participant's Annual Benefit Credits which, in
      the absence of the Limits, would have been Employer Profit
      Sharing Contributions to the Profit Sharing portion of the
      Profit Sharing Program shall be credited to the Participant's
      McCAP I Profit Sharing Investment Account for a calendar
      year.  A Participant's McCAP I Profit Sharing Investment
      Account shall also be credited with any amounts with respect
      to which a Participant has made a Diversification Election,
      as provided in Section 2.5, or any election made by the
      Participant pursuant to Section 2.6.  A Participant's McCAP I
      Profit Sharing Investment Account shall be credited with
      earnings, gains and losses as of each Valuation Date under
      the Profit Sharing Program in an amount equal to the amount
      which such account would have earned, gained or lost if at
      all times fully invested in the same manner as the
      Participant's Profit Sharing Fund Account under the Profit
      Sharing Program.

           (b)  McCAP I McDonald's Common Stock Account.  Subject
      to Section 2.5, the portion of a Participant's Annual Benefit
      Credits which, in the absence of the Limits, would have been
      credited to such Active Participant's Accounts under the
      Profit Sharing Program with respect to Participant Elected
      Contributions, Employer Matching Contributions and Employer
      Leveraged ESOP Contributions shall be credited to the
      Participant's McCap I McDonald's Common Stock Account for a
      calendar year.  A Participant's McCAP I McDonald's Common
      Stock Account shall be credited with net earnings, gains and
      losses as of each Valuation Date under the Profit Sharing
      Program in an amount equal to the amount which such account
      would have earned, gained or lost if such amounts and the
      income credited thereon were at all times fully invested in
      the Profit Sharing McDonald's Common Stock Fund.  

     2.4  Deferral Elections.  Each person who is a participant in
  the Profit Sharing Program and who is designated by the Committee
  as an Active Participant with respect to each calendar year may
  elect by filing a written election with the Committee, in
  accordance with such rules and procedures as the Committee shall
  establish, before the beginning of such calendar year, to have
  the Participant Elected Contributions and Employer Matching
  Contributions described in Section 2.2, if any, credited to his
  McCAP I Account.  An employee who becomes a participant in the
  Profit Sharing Program during a year who is designated by the
  Committee as an Active Participant hereunder, may elect within
  60 days of the date he  becomes a participant in the Profit
  Sharing Program to have the Participant Elected Contributions and
  Employer Matching Contributions, if any, described in Section 2.2
  credited to his McCAP I Account.

      If an Active Participant has an election pursuant to this
  Section 2.4 in effect for a calendar year, such election and the
  Active Participant's elected deferrals under McDESOP may not be
  changed during the year.  If an Active Participant does not have
  an election in effect pursuant to this Section 2.4 for the
  calendar year, any amounts of Participant Elected Contributions
  in excess of the Elective Contribution Limit which are elected by
  such Participant under the McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing
  Program either shall not be contributed or shall be returned to
  him as provided thereunder and no benefit shall be credited to
  him hereunder with respect to his Participant Elected
  Contributions and Employer Matching Contributions under the
  Profit Sharing Program.

     2.5   Diversification of Investments.  If a Participant makes
  a Diversification Election in accordance with Section 10.10 of
  the Profit Sharing Program (the "Diversification Election"), his
  corresponding McCAP I accounts and subaccounts containing the
  contributions and income with respect thereto which, if not for
  the Limits, would have been credited to his accounts under the
  McDESOP or the Leveraged ESOP portions of the Profit Sharing
  Program shall to the same extent be credited to the Participant's
  McCAP I Profit Sharing Investment Account and shall thereafter be
  credited with income as provided in Section 2.3(a).

     2.6   Transfers to the Profit Sharing Investment Account.  A
  Participant may make an irrevocable election to have all amounts
  which have been credited to his McCAP I McDonald's Common Stock
  Account through March 31, 1991, which represent amounts which
  except for the Limits would have been credited to the Profit
  Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program, and any
  accumulated income credited thereon, credited with earnings,
  gains and losses as of each Valuation Date, as defined in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program, equal to the amount which such
  credited amounts would have earned, gained or lost if at all
  times after the effective date of such election such amounts and
  the income credited thereon had been fully invested in the
  Participant's McCAP I Profit Sharing Investment Account.  Any
  election made pursuant to this Section shall be completed,
  delivered to the Committee and made effective in such manner and
  at such time as the Committee shall determine in accordance with
  its rules concerning the manner of making investment elections
  under the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing
  Program.

     2.7  Vesting.  A Participant shall be vested in the portions
  of his McCAP I Account which in the absence of the Limits would
  have been allocated to his Profit Sharing Account under the
  Profit Sharing Program and the earnings, gains or losses thereon
  to the same extent he is vested in his Profit Sharing Account
  under the Profit Sharing Program.  A Participant shall be vested
  in the portions of his McCAP I Account which in the absence of
  the Limits would have been allocated to his Leveraged ESOP
  Account under the Profit Sharing Program and the earnings, gains
  and losses thereon to the same extent he is vested in his
  Leveraged ESOP Account under the Profit Sharing Program.  All
  other amounts credited to a Participant's McCAP I Account and the
  earnings thereon shall be fully vested.

     2.8  Payment of Benefits.  Distributions of the McCAP I
  Account of a Participant who has not made a Delinking Election,
  as provided in Section 2.10(a) or 2.10(b), shall be made as
  follows:

           (a)  McDESOP Portion of McCAP I Account.  The portion of
      a Participant's McCAP I Account which in the absence of the
      Limits would have been benefits provided by the McDESOP
      portion of the Profit Sharing Program shall be paid to him in
      cash at the same time and in the same form (other than in the
      form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company) under
      the McDESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program.

           (b)  Profit Sharing Plan Portion of McCAP I Account. 
      The portion of a Participant's McCAP I Account which in the
      absence of the Limits would have been benefits provided by
      the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program
      shall be paid to the Participant in cash at the same time and
      in the same form (other than in the form of an annuity
      purchased from an insurance company) that his account under
      the Profit Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program
      is paid or commences to be paid.

           (c)  Leveraged ESOP Portion of McCAP I Account.  The
      portion of a Participant's McCAP I Account which in the
      absence of the Limits would have been benefits provided by
      the Leveraged ESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program
      shall be paid to him in cash at the same time and in the same
      form (other than in the form of an annuity contract purchased
      from an insurance company) that benefits are paid under the
      Leveraged ESOP portion of the Profit Sharing Program.

           (d)  Annuity Elections.  A participant in the Profit
      Sharing Program who elects to receive his accounts under the
      Profit Sharing Program in the form of an annuity shall
      receive payment of the same portions of his McCAP I Accounts
      in installment payments over a period certain equal to the
      joint and last survivor life expectancy of the Participant
      and his beneficiary, if any, at the time that the annuity is
      purchased under the Profit Sharing Program.

           (e)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order.  Notwithstand-
      ing the foregoing, no distribution shall be made in
      accordance with Sections 2.8(a), 2.8(b) or 2.8(c) on account
      of the payment, under the Profit Sharing Program, of a
      distribution from the account of a participant who is, at the
      time of distribution, an active McDonald's employee, nor
      shall such a distribution be made on account of a
      distribution made from the Profit Sharing Program in
      accordance with a qualified domestic relations order except
      as provided in Section 3.8.

           (f)  Transaction Costs.  To the extent that the amounts
      described in Section 2.3(b) are distributed to the
      Participant and are used by the Participant or former
      employee to purchase shares of McDonald's stock on the open
      market in one or more transactions within seven months after
      the date such amounts were distributed, the Company shall
      reimburse such Participant or former employee for all
      reasonable brokerage fees and other transaction costs
      incurred by him in connection with such purchases upon
      presentation to the Company not later than 60 days after the
      date of each transaction or satisfactory evidence thereof.

     2.9   Beneficiary Designation.  Absent a Beneficiary Delinking
  Election by a Participant under Section 2.10(c):  

           (a)  A Participant's McCAP I Profit Sharing Account
      shall be paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his
      Profit Sharing Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in
      the same form and same time as distributions are made
      thereunder.

           (b)  A Participant's McCAP I McDESOP Account shall be
      paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his McDESOP
      Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in the same form
      and same time as distributions are made thereunder.

           (c)  A Participant's McCAP I Leveraged ESOP Account
      shall be paid to the beneficiary entitled to receive his
      Leveraged ESOP Accounts under the Profit Sharing Program in
      the same form and the same time as distributions are made
      thereunder.

     2.10  Delinking Election.  Distributions of McCAP I Accounts
  pursuant to a Delinking Election as provided in Section 2.10(b)
  or 2.10(d) (the "Delinking Election") shall be made in accordance
  with this Section 2.10 rather than Section 2.8.  A Participant's
  Delinking Election shall be irrevocable except to the extent
  provided in this Section 2.10.

           (a)  Active Employees.  Each Participant who has made a
      Delinking Election as to distributions to be made in his
      lifetime, as provided herein, shall receive distributions
      after he has a termination of Employment and during his life
      in accordance with this Section 2.10(a) ("Lifetime Delinking
      Election").

                (1)  Time of Lifetime Delinking Election.  A
           Participant who is an active employee on or after
           September 20, 1995, may make a Lifetime Delinking
           Election or a revised Lifetime Delinking Election to
           change the form or timing of distributions under his
           Lifetime Delinking Election at any time.

                (2)  Complete Election.  Each Lifetime Delinking
           Election shall designate the date on which the
           Participant's account balances are to be paid or
           commence to be paid and shall select whether payments
           are to be made in the form of a single sum payment or in
           installments.  Installments may be paid monthly,
           quarterly or annually over a period designated in the
           Lifetime Delinking Election by the Participant which
           period shall not exceed the period specified in
           Section 2.11(b).  A Lifetime Delinking Election shall
           not be effective unless it is complete and includes an
           election as to the timing and form of the distribution
           or distributions.

                (3)  Distribution Election.  Each Participant who
           is an active employee and who has made a Lifetime
           Delinking Election shall be permitted to make a new
           Lifetime Delinking Election changing his elections as to
           the timing and form of his distribution.  Each such
           Lifetime Delinking Election which is made before October
           31, or such earlier date as the Committee shall
           designate by giving notice to Participants, shall be
           effective the next January 1 and shall remain effective
           through at least December 31 of such year.  In the
           absence of a new Lifetime Delinking Election the
           Participant's prior Lifetime Delinking Election shall
           stay in effect from year to year.  The Lifetime
           Delinking Election of a Participant who has a
           Termination of Employment shall become irrevocable.

                (4)  Qualified Domestic Relations Order.  No
           distributions shall be made in accordance with Section
           2.10 on account of the payment, under the Profit Sharing
           Program, of a distribution from the McCAP I Account of a
           Participant who is, at the time of distribution, an
           active McDonald's employee, nor shall such a
           distribution be made on account of a distribution made
           from the Profit Sharing Program in accordance with a
           qualified domestic relations order except as provided in
           Section 3.8.

           (b)  Former Employees.  Each Participant who was a
      former employee on September 20, 1995, may make a Lifetime
      Delinking Election or a Beneficiary Delinking Election, on or
      before October 31, 1995, with respect to his McCAP I, McCAP
      II and McEqual account balances available for distribution
      after December 31, 1995.  Such a Lifetime Delinking Election
      shall be irrevocable in all respects and shall designate both
      the form in which the distributions are to be made (a single
      sum distribution or monthly, quarterly or yearly installments
      paid over a period not to exceed the period specified in
      Section 2.11(b)), and the date on which distributions will be
      made, if in a single sum, or commence to be made, if in
      installments.  Under a Beneficiary Delinking Election, the
      former employee's beneficiary designation under the Profit
      Sharing Program shall no longer apply to designate his
      beneficiary under McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP II and he shall
      complete a separate beneficiary designation which shall not
      name different beneficiaries to receive the Profit Sharing,
      McDESOP, leveraged ESOP and Stock Sharing portions of the
      Plan, McEqual, McCAP II.  Except as provided in this Section
      2.10(b), Lifetime Delinking Elections or Beneficiary
      Delinking Elections shall not be made by former employees.

           (c)  Beneficiary Delinking Election.  Effective at July
      1, 1996 or such earlier date as the Committee designates,
      each Participant who is an active employee may make an
      election to delink his beneficiary designation under the
      Plan, McEqual or McCAP II (a "Beneficiary Delinking
      Election") and may elect to designate beneficiaries to
      receive his McEqual, McCAP I, and McCAP II Accounts which may
      or may not be different persons than the beneficiaries
      designated to receive his Net Balance Accounts under the
      Profit Sharing Program.  Under a Beneficiary Delinking
      Election, a Participant shall not name different
      beneficiaries to receive the Profit Sharing, McDESOP,
      Leveraged ESOP and Stock Sharing portions of the Plan,
      McEqual and McCAP II.  However, several beneficiaries can be
      designated to receive a proportion of the total of such
      benefits.

           (d)  Beneficiary's Elections.  Each beneficiary of a
      deceased Participant who before his death has made a
      Beneficiary Delinking Election and each beneficiary who is
      the beneficiary of a Participant who died before
      September 20, 1995, shall have a one time opportunity to make
      a Delinking Election designating the form (a single sum
      distribution or monthly, quarterly or yearly installments)
      and the date on which distributions will be made, if in a
      single sum, or commence to be made, if in installments (a
      "Form of Payment Delinking Election") as follows:

                (1)  The beneficiary of a former employee who died
           before September 20, 1995, must make his Form of Payment
           Delinking Election hereunder not later than October 31,
           1995 and such election shall be made with respect to
           amounts which otherwise would not be paid until after
           December 31, 1995.  If such a beneficiary does not make
           a Form of Payment Delinking Election, distributions
           shall be made as provided in Section 2.8.

                (2)  The beneficiary of a deceased Participant who
           had made a Beneficiary Delinking Election before his
           death shall make a Form of Payment Delinking Election
           within 183 days of the date of such Participant's death. 
           Whether or not such a beneficiary makes a Form of
           Payment Delinking Election, distributions to such a
           beneficiary shall not commence any earlier than 90 days
           after the one year anniversary of the Participant's
           death.  Distributions made to such a beneficiary in the
           form of installments shall be made over a period not to
           exceed the period specified in Section 2.11(b).  If the
           beneficiary of a deceased Participant who had made a
           Beneficiary Delinking Election before his death does not
           make a Form of Payment Delinking Election, his account
           balances shall be distributed in a single sum no sooner
           than the 90th day after the first anniversary of the
           Participant's death.

                The beneficiary of a beneficiary who was subject to
           a Beneficiary Delinking Election shall receive his
           benefits in a single sum payment as soon as
           administratively feasible after the Valuation Date
           immediately following the beneficiary's death and the
           administrative determination of the identity of such
           beneficiary's beneficiary.

                (3)  If a deceased Participant who has made a
           Delinking Election fails to designate a beneficiary or
           designates as beneficiary an individual who predeceases
           the Participant or an entity which ceases to exist
           before the Participant's death, the Participant's
           beneficiary for purposes of the Plan shall be his
           Beneficiary as designated in the Profit Sharing Plan.

     2.11  Installment Payments.

           (a)  Order of Payment of Accounts.  Installment
      distributions, under a Delinking Election made pursuant to
      Section 2.10, shall be paid:

                (1)  first, from the Participant's or beneficiary's
           leveraged ESOP account under McEqual, McCAP I and
           McCAP II, in that order;

                (2)  second, from the Participant's or
           beneficiary's McDESOP account under McEqual, McCAP I and
           McCAP II, in that order; and

                (3)  last, from the Participant's or beneficiary's
           Profit Sharing account under McEqual, McCAP I and
           McCAP II in that order.

           (b)  Maximum Period of Payment.  Participants or
      Beneficiaries electing to receive installment payments may
      elect to receive substantially equal payments over a fixed
      period of not more than 25 years or payments in a fixed
      dollar amount which shall not be less than the amount which
      at the time the election is made would be expected, assuming
      no interest and no mortality, to result in the payment of the
      Participants' accounts under McEqual, McCAP I and McCAP II in
      a period not in excess of 25 years.

     2.12  Limitation on Elections and Payments.  Notwithstanding
  any other provision of this Section 2:

           (a)  no investment election or other election which is
      permitted hereunder to be made by any individual who is an
      officer or director of the Company for the purposes of
      Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
      (the "Act"), shall be effective before the first date that
      such election could be made effective without being
      considered a nonexempt purchase or sale under Section 16(b)
      of the Act, and

           (b)  no distribution from the Plan shall be made
      hereunder to any person who, at the time of distribution, is,
      or within the immediately preceding six months was, an
      officer or director of the Company for purposes of Section 16
      of the Act before the first date that such distribution would
      not be a nonexempt purchase or sale under Section 16(b) of
      the Act.

     2.13  Valuation of Accounts.  The value of any portion of a
  Participant's McCAP I Profit Sharing Account to be paid in cash
  shall be valued as of the Valuation Date, as defined in the
  McDonald's Profit Sharing Program, preceding the date of payment,
  based upon the value of the Investment Funds under the Profit
  Sharing Plan portion of the Profit Sharing Program.  The value of
  any portion of a Participant's McCAP I McDonald's Common Stock
  Account to be paid in cash shall be valued as of the Valuation
  Date, preceding the date of payment, using the value of
  McDonald's Common Stock determined for the Profit Sharing
  McDonald's Common Stock Fund.

     2.14  Funding.  Benefits payable under the Plan to any person
  shall be paid directly by the Company or other adopting employer
  (collectively called "Employers") which employs such person.  The
  Employers shall not be required to fund, or otherwise segregate
  assets to be used for payment of benefits under the Plan.  While
  the Employers may, in the discretion of the Board of Directors,
  make investments (a) in shares of McDonald's common stock through
  open market purchases or (b) in other investments in amounts
  equal or unequal to amounts payable hereunder, the Employer shall
  not be under any obligation to make such investments and any such
  investment shall remain an asset of the contributing Employer
  subject to the claims of its general creditors.  Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, the Employers, in the discretion of the Company,
  may maintain one or more trusts to hold assets to be used for
  payment of benefits under the Plan; provided that the assets of
  such trust shall be subject to the creditors of the contributing
  Employer in an amount equal to the amount held in the trust
  multiplied by the percentage of all McCAP I Account balances
  which represent amounts credited to Participants on account of
  their being employees of such Employer in the event such Employer
  becomes insolvent or is subject to bankruptcy or insolvency
  proceedings.  Any payments by such a trust of benefits provided
  to a Participant under the Plan shall be considered payment by
  the Participant's Employer and shall discharge such Employer of
  any further liability for the payments made by such trust.


                              Section 3

                            Miscellaneous


     3.1  Plan Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by
  the Committee responsible for administration of the Profit
  Sharing Plan ("Committee").  The Committee shall have, to the
  extent appropriate, the same powers, rights, duties and
  obligations with respect to the Plan as it has with respect to
  the Profit Sharing Program.

     3.2  Employment Rights.  Establishment of the Plan shall not
  be construed to give any employee the right to be retained in the
  Company's service or to any benefits not specifically provided by
  the Plan, nor shall the establishment of the Plan in any manner
  modify the Company's right to modify, amend or terminate the
  Profit Sharing Program McEqual or McCAP II.

     3.3  Interests Not Transferable.  Except as to withholding of
  any tax under the laws of the United States or any state or
  locality or as provided in Section 3.8, no benefit payable at any
  time under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation,
  sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, or other legal
  process, or encumbrance of any kind.  Any attempt to alienate,
  sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such
  benefits, whether currently or thereafter payable, shall be void. 
  No benefit shall, in any manner, be liable for or subject to the
  debts or liabilities of any person entitled to  such benefits. 
  If any person shall attempt to, or shall alienate, sell,
  transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber his benefits under
  the Plan, or if by reason of his bankruptcy or other event
  happening at any time, such benefits would devolve upon any other
  person or would not be enjoyed by the person entitled thereto
  under the Plan, then the Company, in its discretion, may
  terminate the interest in any such benefits of the person
  entitled thereto under the Plan and hold or apply them to or for
  the benefit of such person entitled thereto under the Plan or his
  spouse, children or other dependents, or any of them, in such
  manner as the Company may deem proper.

     3.4  Unclaimed Amounts.  Unclaimed amounts shall consist of
  the amounts of the McCAP I Accounts of a Participant which cannot
  be distributed because of the Committee's inability, after a
  reasonable search within a period of two (2) years after the
  payment of benefits becomes due.  Unclaimed amounts shall be
  forfeited at the end of such two-year period.  These forfeitures
  will reduce the obligations of the Company under the Plan.  After
  an unclaimed amount has been forfeited, the Participant or
  beneficiary, as applicable, shall have no further right to his
  McCAP I Account.

     3.5  Controlling Law.  The law of Illinois, except its law
  with respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all
  matters relating to the Plan to the extent not preempted by
  ERISA.

     3.6  Gender and Number.  Words in the masculine gender shall
  include the feminine, and the plural shall include the singular
  and the singular shall include the plural.

     3.7  Action by the Company.  Except as otherwise specifically
  provided herein, any action required of or permitted by the
  Company under the Plan shall be by resolution of the Board of
  Directors of McDonald's Corporation or any member of the
  Committee or person(s) authorized by resolution of the Board of
  Directors of McDonald's Corporation.

      3.8  Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

           (a)  Notwithstanding Section 3.3, the Committee shall
      comply with the provisions of any order determined by the
      Committee to be a Qualified Relations Order.

           (b)  "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" means any
      judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property
      settlement agreement):

                (1)  which is made pursuant to a state domestic
           relations law (including a community property law);

                (2)  which relates to the provision of child
           support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to
           a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a
           Participant;

                (3)  which creates or recognizes the existence of
           an alternate payee's right to or assigns to an alternate
           payee the right to receive all or a portion of the
           Participant's Accrued Benefit under the Plan; and

                (4)  with respect to which the requirements of
           paragraphs (c) and (d) are met.

           (c)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified
      Domestic Relations Order only if such order clearly
      specifies:

                (1)  the name and the last known mailing address,
           if any, of the Participant and the name and mailing
           address of each alternate payee covered by the order;

                (2)  the amount or percentage of the Participant's
           Accrued Benefit to be paid by the Plan to each such
           alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or
           percentage is to be determined;

                (3)  the number of payments or period to which such
           order applies; and

                (4)  each plan to which such order applies.

           (d)  A domestic relations order can be a Qualified
      Domestic Relations Order only if such order does not

                (1)  require the Plan to provide any type or form
           of benefit, or any option not otherwise provided under
           the Plan;

                (2)  require the Plan to provide increased benefits
           (determined on the basis of actuarial value); or

                (3)  require the payment of benefits to an
           alternate payee which are required to be paid to another
           alternate payee under another order previously
           determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

           (e)  In the case of any payment before a Participant has
      had a termination of employment, a domestic relations order
      shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of
      Section 3.8(d)(l) solely because such order requires that
      payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee:

                (1)  without regard to the Participant's attainment
           of any specified age;

                (2)  as if the Participant had retired on the date
           on which such payment is to begin under such order; and

                (3)  in any form in which such benefits may be paid
           under the Plan to the Participant.


                              Section 4

                      Subsidiary Participation


     4.1  Adoption of Plan.  Any Commonly Controlled Entity,
  Commonly Controlled Corporation, Domestic Affiliate or Foreign
  Affiliate, as defined in the Profit Sharing Program, which has
  adopted a portion of the Profit Sharing Program may, with the
  approval of the Committee and under such terms and conditions as
  the Committee may prescribe, adopt the corresponding portions of
  the Plan by resolution of its board of directors.

     4.2  Withdrawal from the Plan by Participating Employer. 
  While it is not the present intention of any adopting employer to
  withdraw from the Plan, any such employer other than the Company
  shall have the right, at any time, upon the approval of and under
  such conditions as may be provided by the Committee, to withdraw
  from the Plan by delivering to the Committee written notice of
  its election so to withdraw.

      Upon receipt of such notice by the Committee, the McCAP I
  Accounts of Participants employed by the withdrawing employer as
  of the date of withdrawal shall be distributed by such employer
  in cash at such time or times as the Committee, in its sole
  discretion, may deem to be in the best interest of such
  Participants or their beneficiaries.


                              Section 5

                      Amendment and Termination


      5.1  Company Authority to Amend.  The Company intends the
  Plan to be permanent, but reserves the right at any time by
  action of its Board of Directors or by the Committee (in
  accordance with the restrictions in the following paragraph) to
  modify, amend or terminate the Plan, notwithstanding that an
  amendment may change the timing or the optional form of benefit
  elected by a Participant in a Delinking Election or the timing or
  optional form of benefit in which a Participant's or
  beneficiary's benefits would otherwise have been paid under
  Section 2, provided, however, that if a Participant has a McCAP I
  Account, benefits provided under Section 2.1 shall constitute an
  irrevocable obligation of the employer to the same extent that
  such McCAP I Account, had it been an account under the Profit
  Sharing Program, would have been an irrevocable obligation of the
  Profit Sharing Program.

      5.2  Committee Authority to Amend.  The Committee shall have
  the same authority with respect to the adoption of amendments to
  the Plan as the Board of Directors in the following
  circumstances:

           (a)  to adopt amendments to the Plan which the Committee
      determines are necessary or desirable for the Plan to comply
      with or to obtain benefits or advantages under the provisions
      of applicable law, regulations or rulings or requirements of
      the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental
      administrative agency or changes in such law, regulations,
      rulings or requirements; and

           (b)  to adopt any other procedural or cosmetic amendment
      that the Committee determines to be necessary or desirable
      that does not materially change benefits to Participants or
      their beneficiaries or materially increase the Company's or
      adopting employers' contributions to the Plan.

      The Committee shall provide notice of amendments adopted by
  the Committee to the Board of Directors on a timely basis.

      Executed in multiple originals this 18th day of December, 1995.
