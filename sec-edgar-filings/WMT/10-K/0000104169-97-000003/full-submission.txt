                 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION
                                     
This  Form  10-K  includes certain statements that  may  be  deemed  to  be
"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of the Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this Form 10-K which  address
activities,  events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates
will  or  may occur in the future, including such things as future  capital
expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), expansion and other
development  trends  of industry segments in which the Company  is  active,
business  strategy,  expansion and growth of  the  Company's  business  and
operations and other such matters are forward-looking statements.  Although
the  Company  believes  the expectations expressed in such  forward-looking
statements  are based on reasonable assumptions within the  bounds  of  its
knowledge  of its business, a number of factors could cause actual  results
to   differ   materially  from  those  expressed  in  any   forward-looking
statements,  whether oral or written, made by or on behalf of the  Company.
Many  of  these  factors  have previously been  identified  in  filings  or
statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

All phases of the Company's operations are subject to influences outside
its control. Any one, or a combination, of these factors could materially
affect the results of the Company's operations. These factors include:
competitive pressures, inflation, consumer debt levels, currency exchange
fluctuations, trade restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates,
interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions. Forward-
looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company are based on a
knowledge of its business and the environment in which it operates, but
because of the factors listed above, actual results may differ from those
in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, all of the forward-looking
statements made are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can
be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the
Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will
have the expected consequences to or effects on the Company or its business
or operations.

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

          (a)  General Development of Business

                Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together  with  its  subsidiaries
hereinafter  referred  to as the "Company") is America's  largest  retailer
measured by total revenues.  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997,
the  Company  had  net  sales  of  $104,859,000,000.   The  Company  serves
customers  primarily  through the operation of  Wal-Mart  stores  (discount
department  stores), Sam's Clubs (warehouse membership clubs) and  Wal-Mart
Supercenters  (combination full-line supermarket  and  discount  department
stores).  Domestically, at January 31, 1997, the Company operated 1,960 Wal-
Mart  stores,  436  Sam's Clubs, and 344 Wal-Mart  Supercenters.   A  table
summarizing  information concerning domestic Wal-Mart stores, Sam's  Clubs,
Wal-Mart Supercenters and other stores operated since January 31,  1992  is
set forth in Schedule A to Item I found on page 9 of this annual report.

                In fiscal 1992, the Company entered into a joint venture in
which  it has a 50% interest with CIFRA S.A. de C.V. to develop and  expand
retailing  services  in  Mexico.   This was  the  beginning  of  Wal-Mart's
initiative  outside  of the United States.  Today,  our  joint  venture  is
Mexico's largest retailer.  At January 31, 1997, the joint venture operated
28 warehouse clubs and 18 Wal-Mart Supercenters, along with 106 CIFRA joint
venture units throughout Mexico.

                In  fiscal  1993, the Company entered Puerto  Rico  and  at
January 31, 1997, operated seven Wal-Mart stores and four Sam's Clubs.

                In  fiscal  1995, the Company acquired 122 Canadian  Woolco
department  stores from Woolworth Canada, Inc., a subsidiary  of  Woolworth
Corporation.   The acquisition included all inventory, leasehold  interests
and  other  assets  at each location.  Today Wal-Mart is  Canada's  leading
discount  retailer.  At January 31, 1997, the Company operated 136 Canadian
Wal-Mart stores.

                In  fiscal 1996, the Company entered Brazil through a joint
venture  in  which it has a 60% interest with Lojas Americanas. At  January
31,  1997,  the joint venture operated two Wal-Mart Supercenters and  three
warehouse clubs in the greater-Sao Paulo area.

                Also  in fiscal 1996, the Company entered Argentina and  at
January  31, 1997, operated three Wal-Mart Supercenters and three warehouse
clubs in the greater-Buenos Aires region.

               In fiscal 1997, the Company entered the People's Republic of
China.  At  January 31, 1997, the Company operated one Wal-Mart Supercenter
along  with joint-venture partner Shenzhen International Trust & Investment
Company  and one warehouse club along with joint-venture partner,  Shenzhen
Economic Zone Development Company.

                In  fiscal  1997, the Company entered Indonesia  through  a
franchise  agreement. At January 31, 1997, Wal-Mart operated  two  Wal-Mart
Supercenters in the Jakarta area.

                A  table  summarizing information concerning  international
units operated since fiscal 1992 is set forth in Schedule B to Item 1 found
on page 10 of this annual report.


          (b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments

                Sales  of merchandise through stores which include Wal-Mart
stores,  Sam's  Clubs  and Wal-Mart Supercenters is  the  only  significant
industry segment of which the Company is a part.  For the financial results
of  the Company's operations, see the information incorporated by reference
in Item 7 and Item 8 of Part II found on page 14 of this annual report.


          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

                The  Company,  a  Delaware corporation, has  its  principal
offices in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated in
October  1969, the businesses conducted by its predecessors began  in  1945
when  Sam  M.  Walton  opened  a franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in
Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar
store  in  Versailles,  Missouri.  Until 1962, the Company's  business  was
devoted  entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In  that  year,  the
first  Wal-Mart  Discount  City was opened.  In fiscal  1984,  the  Company
opened  its first three Sam's Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its first Wal-Mart
Supercenter.   Through  the years, the Company has made  certain  strategic
acquisitions  that have supported the growth of the Wal-Mart stores,  clubs
and  Supercenters;  such as the acquisition of ten  full-service  and  four
specialty distribution centers through the purchase of McLane Company, Inc.
which  sells and distributes merchandise to the convenience store  industry
and  a  variety of other retailers; the acquisition of selected  assets  of
Pace  Membership  Warehouse, Inc. and the acquisition  of  selected  assets
related  to  122  Canadian  Woolco stores from Woolworth  Canada,  Inc.,  a
subsidiary of Woolworth Corporation.

           General.  The Company operates Wal-Mart stores in all 50 states.
The  average  size of a Wal-Mart store is approximately 92,600 square  feet
with  store sizes generally ranging between 30,000 and 150,000 square  feet
of  building area.  The Company operates Wal-Mart Supercenter stores in  23
states, and the average size of a Supercenter store is 183,300 square feet.

           The Company operates Sam's Clubs in 48 states.  The average size
of  a  Sam's  Club  is approximately 121,200 square feet,  and  club  sizes
generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet of building area.

           The  Company operates Wal-Mart stores, Sam's Clubs and  Wal-Mart
Supercenters in Argentina, Canada and Puerto Rico, and under joint  venture
or franchise agreements in Brazil, China, Indonesia and Mexico.

           During  the  last fiscal year, no single store or club  location
accounted for as much as 1% of sales or net income.

           Merchandise.   Wal-Mart stores are generally organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys and infants.  Each store also  carries  curtains,
fabrics  and  notions,  candy,  stationery and  books,  shoes,  housewares,
hardware,  electronics,  home  furnishings,  small  appliances,  automotive
accessories,  horticulture and accessories, sporting goods,  toys,  cameras
and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals and jewelry.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  in  the stores.  The Company markets lines of merchandise under  the
store  brands  "Sam's  American  Choice",  "Great  Value",  "Ol'  Roy"  and
"Equate".   The  Company also markets lines of merchandise  under  licensed
brands; some of which include "Faded Glory", "Kathie Lee", "Better Homes  &
Gardens", "White Stag", "McKids", "Popular Mechanics" and "Catalina".

           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997, domestic sales of
general  merchandise at Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters (which are subject
to  seasonal variance), including licensed departments, by product category
were as follows:


                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

          Softgoods/domestics..............        25%
          Hardgoods........................        25
          Stationery and candy.............        11
          Pharmaceuticals..................        10
          Records and electronics..........         9
          Sporting goods and toys..........         8
          Health and beauty aids...........         8
          Shoes............................         2
          Jewelry..........................         2
                                                  100%


           Sales in pharmaceuticals are a combination of owned and licensed
departments.    While   these  percentages  include   sales   of   licensed
departments,  the  Company  records only  the  rentals  received  from  the
licensee as other income.

           Sam's  offers bulk displays of name brand hardgood  merchandise,
some  softgoods  and  institutional size grocery items.   Each  Sam's  also
carries  jewelry, sporting goods, toys, tires, stationery and books.   Most
clubs have fresh food departments which include bakery, meat and produce.

          McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery products,
including  perishable  and non-perishable items.  The non-grocery  products
consist  primarily  of tobacco products, hardgood merchandise,  health  and
beauty  aids, toys and stationery.  McLane is a wholesale distributor  that
sells  its  merchandise to a variety of retailers, including the  Company's
Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs.

           Operations.   Except for extended hours during  certain  holiday
seasons,  the  majority of the Wal-Mart stores are open from 9:00  a.m.  to
9:00  p.m.  six days a week, and from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  on  Sundays,
with  the  remainder of the stores being closed on Sunday.   An  increasing
number of Wal-Mart stores and almost all of the Supercenter stores are open
24  hours each day.  Wal-Mart stores maintain uniform prices, except  where
lower  prices are necessary to meet local competition.  Sales are primarily
on  a  self-service, cash-and-carry basis with the objective of  maximizing
sales volume and inventory turnover while minimizing expenses.  Bank credit
card  programs, operated without recourse to the Company, are available  in
all stores.  During the year, the Company launched a co-branded credit card
program  through Chase Manhattan Bank.  This card is also operated  without
recourse  to  the  Company.  Wal-Mart stores and  Supercenters  maintain  a
"satisfaction  guaranteed"  program  to  promote  customer   goodwill   and
acceptance.

           Sam's  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "Sam's Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.   Any credit issued under these programs are without  recourse  to
the Company.  Club members include businesses and those individuals who are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees  and credit union members.  Both business and individual  members
have an annual membership fee of $25 for the primary membership card.

           Operating  hours vary among Sam's Clubs, but they are  generally
open  Monday  through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.  Most  Sam's  are
open Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and on Sunday from 11:00 a.m.  to
6:00 p.m.

           Distribution.  During the 1997 fiscal year, approximately 84% of
the  Wal-Mart  stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped  from  Wal-
Mart's  34  distribution centers, five located in both Arkansas and  Texas;
two  in  California,  Florida, Indiana, Mississippi,  New  York  and  South
Carolina;  and  one  each  in  Alabama, Colorado,  Georgia,  Iowa,  Kansas,
Kentucky,  New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.
The  balance  was  shipped  directly to the stores  from  suppliers.   Each
distribution  center  is  designed  to  serve  the  distribution  needs  of
approximately 80 to 140 stores, depending on the size of the  center.   The
size  of  these distribution centers ranges from approximately  700,000  to
1,600,000  square  feet.   Sam's  Clubs  receive  the  majority  of   their
merchandise  via  direct  shipment from  suppliers  rather  than  from  the
Company's distribution centers.

            The  McLane  distribution  centers  buy,  sell  and  distribute
merchandise,  primarily  to the convenience store industry  and  they  also
service  Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs.  The McLane Company
has  19 distribution centers with two located in Arizona, California, Texas
and  Virginia,  and  one  each  in Colorado,  Florida,  Georgia,  Illinois,
Kentucky,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  New  York,  North  Carolina,  Utah  and
Washington.

           Merchandising.   Substantially all purchasing and  merchandising
for  all  stores is controlled from the home offices of the Company through
centralized buying and planning practices.  During the fiscal year 1997, no
single supplier accounted for more than 4.6% of the Company's purchases.

           Store  Management.  Every retail outlet is managed  by  a  store
manager  or  club general manager and one or more assistant store  or  club
managers.  The  Company  is  committed to  ongoing  training  programs  for
managers, assistant managers and department managers in an effort to assure
well trained future store management.

           Fiscal 1998 Expansion Plans. Domestically, the Company plans  to
open   approximately   50  new  Wal-Mart  stores  and   100   Supercenters.
Approximately  70  of  the new Supercenters will come from  relocations  or
expansions  of  existing Wal-Mart stores.  The Company also plans  to  open
five  to  ten  new Sam's Clubs and four distribution centers. International
expansion  includes  30 to 35 new Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters  and  Sam's
Clubs  in  Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Indonesia, Mexico  and  Puerto
Rico.  The Company expenses its start-up costs for each new unit during the
first  full  month  of operation.  Delays may be experienced  in  projected
opening  dates because of construction problems, weather and other reasons.
There can be no assurance that planned expansion will proceed as scheduled.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  Company's  business  is
seasonal  to  a  certain extent.  Generally, the highest  volume  of  sales
occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during the
first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  The Company's Wal-Mart stores compete  with  other
discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are
national chains.  Sam's Clubs compete with wholesale clubs, as well as with
discount  retailers, wholesale grocers and general merchandise  wholesalers
and distributors.  The Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other supercenter-
type  stores, discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores,  many  of
which are national or regional chains.  The Company also competes with  the
other  stores  for new store sites.  As of January 31, 1997, based  on  net
sales,  the  Company ranked first among all retail department store  chains
and among all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers.  The
Company  has  many programs designed to meet the competitive needs  of  its
industry.   These  include the "Everyday Low Price", "Item  Merchandising",
"Store-Within-a-Store", "Our Business is Saving Your  Business  Money"  and
"Buy  America" programs.  Although the Company believes it has had a  major
influence  in  most of the retail markets in which its stores are  located,
there is no assurance that this will continue.

           Employees (Associates).  As of January 31, 1997, the Company had
approximately  728,000  associates, an  increase  of  approximately  53,000
associates  for  the  year.   Part-time  associates  are  primarily   sales
personnel.  Most associates participate in incentive programs which provide
the  opportunity to receive addition compensation based upon the  Company's
productivity or profitability.

          The Company maintains profit sharing plans under which most full-
and  many part-time associates participate following one year of employment
with the Company.  Annual contributions, based on the profitability of  the
Company,  are made at the sole discretion of the Company.  For  the  fiscal
years  ended  January  31, 1992 through 1997, the Company  has  contributed
approximately   $130,000,000,  $166,000,000,  $166,000,000,   $175,000,000,
$204,000,000 and $247,000,000, respectively.

           The  Company also offers an associate stock ownership plan  that
provides  for the voluntary purchase of the Company's common stock  with  a
15% match by the Company on up to $1,800 of annual stock purchases.

Sam's  Clubs  is  incorporated  by reference to  the  table  under  the  caption
"Fiscal  1997  End  of  Year Store Counts" on Page 19 of the  Annual  Report  to
Shareholders for the year ended January 31, 1997.

            The  Company  owns  1,232  properties  on  which  domestic  Wal-Mart

leases  for  its  stores provide for fixed annual rentals and,  in  many  cases,
the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume.

           The  Company  operated  34 Wal-Mart distribution  facilities  and  19
McLane   distribution  facilities  at  January  31,  1997.   These  distribution
facilities  are  primarily  owned by the Company, and  several  are  subject  to
mortgage  securing  loans.   Some  of  the distribution  facilities  are  leased
under  industrial  development  bond  financing  arrangements  and  provide  the
option  of  purchasing  these  facilities at the  end  of  the  lease  term  for
nominal amounts.

           The  Company  leases  properties on which  Canadian  Wal-Mart  stores
are   located.   The  Company  owns  four  properties  on  which   Puerto   Rico
operating  units  are  located  with  the remaining  units  being  leased.   The
Company  owns  properties  on which the operating units  in  Argentina,  Brazil,
China and Mexico are located.

serve  as  the  home  office and owns additional office  facilities  in  Temple,
Texas.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

            The   Company  is  not  a  party  to  any  material  pending   legal
proceedings  and  no  properties of the Company  are  subject  to  any  material
pending  legal  proceeding,  other than routine  litigation  incidental  to  its
business.

                WAL-MART STORES, INC. RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN
Purpose.    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart") believes it is important to 
provide incentives to Wal-Mart's Associates through participation in the 
ownership of Wal-Mart. This Restricted Stock Plan (the "Plan") is established
to provide incentives to those Associates receiving Awards under this Plan to
enhance their job performance, to remain or become associated with Wal-Mart 
and its Affiliates, and to increase the success of Wal-Mart. The Plan is not
limited to executive officers of Wal-Mart, but will be available to provide 
incentives to any Associate that the Committee believes has made or may make
a significant contribution to Wal-Mart or an Affiliate of Wal-Mart.

Definitions.  When used in the Plan, the following words have the definitions 
given to them below.

"Affiliate" means any corporation, company limited by shares, partnership, 
limited liability company, business trust, other entity, or other business 
association that is controlled by Wal-Mart.

"Associate" means any individual who is employed by Wal-Mart or one of its 
Affiliates.

"Award" means the award of Restricted Stock under this Plan and the terms and 
conditions on which that award is made.

"Board of Directors" means the Board of Directors of Wal-Mart.

"Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations 
promulgated thereunder. 

"Committee" means (1) as to Associates who are Section 16 Persons, the 
Compensation Committee and 2) as to all other Associates, the committee that 
administers the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Option Plan of 1994 or any 
successor stock option plan for persons other than Section 16 Persons.

"Compensation Committee" means the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the 
Board of Directors.

"Dividend Plan" means the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

"Recipient" means an Associate who has received an Award.

"Restricted Stock" means Shares awarded to a Recipient under this Plan that 
remain subject to a Restriction and all non-cash proceeds of such Shares that
become and remain subject to a Restriction.

"Restriction" means the contractual condition(s) contained in an Award that if 
not met will result in the forfeiture to Wal-Mart of some or all of the Shares 
issued to the Recipient pursuant to such Award and the non-cash proceeds of 
such Shares.

"Section 16 Person" means any Associate who is required to file reports under 
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

"Shares" means shares of the Common Stock, $.10 par value per share, of 
Wal-Mart.

Shares Subject to the Plan.Wal-Mart has reserved a total of 10,000,000 Shares 
for issuance under the Plan. These Shares may be authorized, but unissued 
Shares, or treasury Shares held by Wal-Mart or an Affiliate. Any Shares 
previously awarded to Recipient that have been forfeited to Wal-Mart may be 
awarded again under the Plan. No fractional shares may be issued under the 
Plan. If a stock split occurs with respect to the Shares, the number of 
Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan shall be proportionately 
increased. If a reverse stock split occurs with respect to the Shares, the 
number of Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan shall be 
proportionately decreased.

Administration.  The Committee will administer the Plan and make Awards. The 
Committee shall have these duties as to the Plan:

(1)  to establish any rules, procedures, and written forms that will govern 
the Plan and assist in the Plan's general administration; 

(2)  when a situation is not expressly addressed by the Plan, to interpret 
the Plan's pertinent provisions and apply them to the situation;

(3)  when a situation is not expressly addressed by the terms of an Award or 
those terms are subject to interpretation, to interpret the pertinent terms 
of that Award and apply them to the situation; 

(4)  to assist in the resolution of any dispute arising about the Plan or an 
Award;

(5)  to recommend amendments of the Plan to the Board of Directors;

(6)  to determine those Associates to whom Awards will be made;

(7)  to set the terms and conditions of those Awards; 

(8)  to amend the terms of an Award;

(9)  to waive any conditions or obligations of a Recipient under or with 
respect to an Award; and 

(10) to administer the terms of each Award made and monitor the compliance of 
the Recipient with the terms and conditions of the Award.

The Committee may act at its discretion in the discharge of the foregoing 
duties.  The Committee will not have the right to amend the terms or 
conditions of any Award without the consent of the Recipient if the amendment
would affect the terms and conditions of the Award in a materially adverse 
manner unless the Committee has expressly retained the right to do so in the 
terms and conditions of the Award.  Subject to the foregoing, the Committee 
may amend any Award under which a Recipient still holds Restricted Stock if 
the Committee determines such amendment is in the best interests of Wal-Mart.  
If an Award is intended to qualify for the performance-based compensation 
exception under Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, the Compensation Committee 
will exercise its discretion to qualify the Award for such exception.

The Awards.

(1)  Wal-Mart, acting through the Committee and consistent with the purposes of
this Plan, may make Awards to such Associates as the Committee may determine 
in its sole discretion.

(2)  Each Award shall have those terms and conditions of Awards that are 
expressly set forth in, or are required, by this Plan and such other terms 
and conditions as the Committee making the Award may determine in its 
discretion.

(3)  During the Restriction period as to any Recipient's Restricted Stock, 
the Recipient shall receive the dividends paid on the Restricted Stock and 
shall not be required to return such dividends to Wal-Mart in the event of 
the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock.  In addition, during the Restriction 
period as to any Recipient's Restricted Stock, the Recipient shall receive 
the proceeds of the Restricted Stock in any stock split, reverse stock split, 
recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of Wal-Mart, which 
proceeds shall automatically and without need for any other action become 
Restricted Stock and be subject to the Restriction then existing as to the 
Recipient's Restricted Stock.  Such  Restriction will thereafter apply 
proportionately to all of the Recipient's Restricted Stock, including such
proceeds.

(4)  The Recipient shall be entitled to vote the Restricted Stock during the 
Restriction period.

(5)  The Restricted Stock will be issued to each Recipient subject to the 
understanding that, during the Restriction period, the Recipient shall not 
have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant 
any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber 
any shares of Restricted Stock or any interest therein.  As a result of such
retention of rights in the Restricted Stock by Wal-Mart, except as required 
by any law, neither any shares of the Restricted Stock nor any interest 
therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, 
transfer, conveyance, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other 
disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, 
whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or 
any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any 
bankruptcy or other creditors' rights law.  Any action attempting to effect 
any such transaction shall be null, void, and without effect.

(6)  Unless expressly provided for in the Award made to a Recipient, any 
Restricted Stock held by a Recipient at the time the Recipient ceases to be 
an Associate for any reason whatsoever shall be forfeited by the Recipient to
Wal-Mart and automatically re-conveyed to Wal-Mart.

(7)  The Committee may withhold any amounts necessary to collect any 
withholding taxes with respect to any Award or upon the fulfillment of the 
Restriction in such Award.  These provisions may include, at the discretion 
of the Committee, the withholding of shares of the Restricted Stock granted 
in the Award to provide for payment of the withholding amount.

(8)  The making of Awards and issuance of any Restricted Stock is subject to 
compliance by Wal-Mart with all applicable laws.  Wal-Mart need not issue or
transfer Restricted Stock pursuant to the Plan unless Wal-Mart's legal 
counsel has approved all legal matters in connection with the issuance and 
delivery of the Restricted Stock.

(9)  Once the conditions in a Restriction are met as to any shares of 
Restricted Stock held by a Recipient, those Shares shall be free of all of 
the terms and conditions of the related Award and the Recipient shall be 
entitled to hold and dispose of the Shares free of any and all restrictions, 
except any restrictions on the transfer or disposition of such Shares as are 
imposed by applicable law.

Evidence of Share Ownership.  The Restricted Stock will be book-entry shares 
only unless the Committee decides to issue certificates to evidence shares of 
the Restricted Stock. Any stock certificate or certificates representing the 
Restricted Stock issued to a Recipient (each a "Certificate") that is so 
issued shall bear the following legend:

     THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ISSUED
     PURSUANT TO THE WAL-MART STORES, INC. RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN (THE
     "PLAN") AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR
     TRANSFER AND TO FORFEITURE TO WAL-MART STORES, INC. IF CERTAIN
     CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET.  SUCH RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS ARE SET
     FORTH IN THE PLAN AND IN THE AWARD PURSUANT TO WHICH SUCH SHARES
     WERE ISSUED TO THE REGISTERED HOLDER THEREOF.

Wal-Mart will place stop-transfer instructions with respect to all Restricted 
Stock on its stock transfer records.  Any Certificate issued will be held in 
escrow by the Committee for the mutual benefit of the Recipient and Wal-Mart 
in accordance with such rules for such escrow as the Committee may establish 
pending the fulfillment of the Restriction and compliance with the other 
terms and conditions of the Award.  If any shares of Restricted Stock are 
forfeited in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Award and this 
Plan, the forfeited shares of Restricted Stock shall be automatically 
re-conveyed to Wal-Mart. Any Certificate representing the forfeited shares of 
Restricted Stock shall be canceled. The Recipient must deliver to the 
Committee a stock power, executed in blank, relating to the shares of the 
Restricted Stock at the time the Award is granted and the Restricted Stock 
issued.  Such a stock power must be given to the Committee as to any 
Certificate issued to a Recipient.

Section 162(m)(4)(C) Matters.  The Compensation Committee may grant an Award 
that provides for a Restriction as to Restricted Stock that is based on 
performance-based criteria and that is intended to qualify for the 
performance-based exception under Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code (a "162 
Award"). In granting any 162 Award, the Compensation Committee shall comply 
fully with the regulations promulgated with respect to Section 162(m) of the 
Code.

Limitations of Wal-Mart's and the Affiliates' Liability and Obligations.  
Receiving an Award or being the owner of Restricted Stock shall not:

(a)  give the Recipient any rights except as expressly set forth in this Plan or
in the Award and except as a stockholder of Wal-Mart with respect to the 
Restricted Stock alone;

(b)  be considered a contract of employment or give the Recipient any right 
to continued employment, or to hold any position, with Wal-Mart or any 
Affiliate; 

(c)  create any fiduciary or other obligation of Wal-Mart or any Affiliate to 
take any action or provide to the Recipient any assistance or dedicate or 
permit the use of any assets of Wal-Mart or any Affiliate that would permit 
the Recipient to be able to attain any performance criteria stated in the 
Recipient's Award;

(d)  create any trust or any fiduciary or other duty or obligation of 
Wal-Mart or any Affiliate to engage in any particular business, continue to 
engage in any particular business, engage in any particular business 
practices, or sell any particular product or products; or 

(e)  create any obligation of Wal-Mart or any Affiliate that shall be greater 
than the obligations of Wal-Mart or such Affiliate to any general unsecured 
creditor of Wal-Mart or the Affiliate.

The entry into, the change of, or a discontinuation of a particular business, 
line of business, business practice, or transaction shall not be, and shall 
not be deemed to be, an amendment or termination of this Plan or any Award. 
If Wal-Mart or an Affiliate terminates a Recipient's employment or other 
position with Wal-Mart or the Affiliate, the potential value of any 
Restricted Stock that must be returned to Wal-Mart will not be an element of
any damages that the Recipient may have for any termination of employment or 
other relationship in violation of any contractual or other rights the 
Recipient may have.

No Liability of Committee Members.  No member of the Committee shall be 
personally liable by reason of this Plan, any Award granted hereunder, or any 
agreement or other instrument entered into or executed by the Committee 
member in his or her capacity as a member of the Committee nor as a result of
any mistake of judgment made in good faith.  Wal-Mart shall indemnify and 
hold harmless each member of the Committees and each other officer and 
director of Wal-Mart or any Affiliate that has any duty or power relating to 
the administration of this Plan against any liability, obligation, cost or 
expense incurred by such person arising out of any act or omission to act in 
connection with the Plan or any Award unless that act or omission to act 
constitutes gross negligence, malfeasance, bad faith or fraud of such person.

Amendment and Termination of the Plan.  The Board of Directors may amend or 
terminate this Plan at any time without the approval of the Recipients or any
other person, except to the extent any such action is required to be approved
by the stockholders of Wal-Mart in connection with any outstanding or future 
162 Awards.  No Award as to which Restricted Stock remains outstanding at the
time of any amendment or termination of the Plan will be affected by such 
amendment or termination.

Governing Law.  This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the laws of the State of Arkansas, except that any matters relating to 
the internal governance of Wal-Mart shall be governed by the General 
Corporation Law of Delaware.

Net Sales
     The sales increase in fiscal 1997 was attributable to the Company's
expansion program and comparative store sales increases of 5%. Expansion for
fiscal 1997 included the opening of 59 Wal-Mart stores, 105 Supercenters
(including the conversion of 92 Wal-Mart stores), 9 SAM'S Clubs, and 38
international units. The majority of the sales increase resulted from
Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters while International sales grew to
approximately 4.8% of the total sales in fiscal 1997 from 4.0% in fiscal 1996.
 SAM'S Club sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 20.4% in
fiscal 1996 to 18.9% in fiscal 1997.
     The sales increase of 13% in fiscal 1996 was attributable to the
Company's expansion program and comparative store sales increases of 4%.
Expansion for fiscal 1996 included the opening of 92 Wal-Mart stores, 92
Supercenters (including the conversion of 80 Wal-Mart stores), 9 SAM'S Clubs
and 50 International units. International sales accounted for approximately
2.1% of the sales increase with the remainder primarily attributable to
Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters. SAM'S Club sales as a percentage of total
sales decreased from 22.9% in fiscal 1995 to 20.4% in fiscal 1996.

Costs and Expenses
     Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased .2% in fiscal 1997 and
 .1% in fiscal 1996 when compared to the preceding year. The increase in
fiscal 1997 is due in part to one-time markdowns in the third quarter
resulting from a strategic decision to reduce the merchandise assortment in
selected categories. Cost of sales also increased approximately .3% due to a
larger percentage of consolidated sales from departments within Wal-Mart
stores which have lower markon percents, and to the Company's continuing
commitment of always providing low prices. These increases were offset by
approximately .2% because SAM'S Club comprised a lower percentage of
consolidated sales in 1997 at a lower contribution to gross margin than the
stores. The increase in fiscal 1996 was due to lower initial markons and a
larger percentage of consolidated sales from departments within Wal-Mart
stores which have lower markon percents. This increase is offset by
approximately .3% because SAM'S Club comprised a lower percentage of
consolidated sales in 1996 at a lower contribution to gross margin than the
stores.
     Operating, selling and general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales were flat in fiscal 1997 when compared to fiscal 1996 and
increased .4% in fiscal 1996 when compared to fiscal 1995. As sales in SAM'S
Club decreased as a percentage of total sales, the Company's operating,
selling and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
increased approximately .1% due to a lower expense to sales percentage at
SAM'S Club compared to the stores and Supercenters. This increase was offset
through expense control in all of the operating formats. Approximately .2% of
the increase in fiscal 1996 was due to increases in payroll and related
benefit costs. The remainder of the increase resulted primarily from a lower
percentage of sales attributable to SAM'S Club and a higher percentage of
sales attributable to international operations. SAM'S Club operating, selling
and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were lower
than the Wal-Mart stores and Supercenters while international expenses were
slightly higher.
     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" in fiscal 1997. The statement requires
entities to review long-lived assets and certain intangible assets in certain
circumstances, and if the value of the assets is impaired, an impairment loss
shall be recognized. The Company's existing accounting policies were such
that this pronouncement did not materially affect the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

Interest Cost
     Interest cost decreased in fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996 due to
lower average daily short-term borrowings and through retirement of maturing
debt. The Company was able to reduce short-term debt through enhanced
operating cash flows and lower capital spending. Interest cost increased in
fiscal 1996 compared to 1995 due to increased indebtedness and increased
average short-term borrowing rates. The increased indebtedness was primarily
due to the Company's expansion program. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on interest and debt.

International Operations
     The Company has wholly owned operations in Argentina, Canada and Puerto
Rico, and through joint ventures in Brazil, China and Mexico. International
operations remain immaterial to total Company operations. However, their
sales growth in fiscal 1997 exceeded all other operating formats. As a group,
the international operations were profitable in fiscal 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Information
     Cash flow provided from operations was $5.9 billion in fiscal 1997, up
from $2.4 billion in fiscal 1996. The increase was primarily due to a greater
emphasis on inventory management that resulted in lowering unit inventory
levels. Although consolidated net sales increased by 12% in fiscal 1997,
consolidated inventories decreased slightly from the prior year end. After
funding capital expenditures of more than $2.6 billion, operating cash flow
provided an excess of almost $3.3 billion. This enabled the Company to reduce
short-term borrowings, retire maturing debt and pay dividends. At January 31,
1997, the Company eliminated short term borrowings and had $883 million
invested in cash and cash equivalents. The Company anticipates that cash
flows from operations will continue to exceed future capital expenditures.
The excess cash flows generated may be used to purchase Company stock, pay
dividends or for other investing or financing needs.

Company Stock Purchases and Common Stock Dividends
     In fiscal 1997, the Company purchased over 8 million shares of its
common stock for $208 million. Subsequent to January 31, 1997, the Company
announced plans to purchase up to $2 billion of its common stock over the
next 18 months. Additionally, the Company increased the dividend 29% to $.27
per share for fiscal 1998.

Expansion
     Domestically, the Company plans to open approximately 50 new Wal-Mart
stores, and 100 Supercenters. Approximately 70 of the Supercenters will come
from relocations or expansions of existing Wal-Mart stores. The Company also
plans to open 5 to 10 new SAM'S Clubs and 4 distribution centers.
International expansion includes 30 to 35 new Wal-Mart stores, Supercenters,
and SAM'S Clubs in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico and Puerto Rico.
Total planned capital expenditures for 1998 approximates $3 billion. The
Company plans to primarily finance expansion with operating cash flows.

Borrowing Information
     The Company had committed lines of credit of $2,450 million with 34
banks and informal lines with various banks totaling an additional $2,450
million which were used to support short-term borrowing and commercial paper.
These lines of credit and their anticipated cyclical increases will be
sufficient to finance the seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and
for other cash requirements.
     The Company anticipates generating sufficient operating cash flow to
fund all capital expenditures and accordingly, does not plan to finance
future capital expenditures with debt. However, the Company may desire to
obtain long-term financing for other uses of cash or for strategic reasons.
The Company foresees no difficulty in obtaining long-term financing in view
of its excellent credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt market
in the past few years. In addition to the available credit lines mentioned
above, the Company may sell up to $751 million of public debt under shelf
registration statements previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Foreign Currency Translation
     All foreign operations are measured in their local currencies with the
exception of Brazil, operating in a highly inflationary economy, which
reports operations using U.S. dollars. Beginning in fiscal 1998, Mexico will
report as a highly inflationary economy. All foreign operations as a group
are immaterial to the Company's consolidated results of operations and
financial position. In fiscal 1997, the foreign currency translation
adjustment decreased by $12 million to $400 million primarily due to a
favorable exchange rate in Canada. The cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustments of $412 and $256 million in fiscal 1996 and 1995,
respectively, were primarily due to operations in Mexico. The Company
periodically purchases forward contracts on firm commitments to minimize the
risk of foreign currency fluctuations. None of these contracts were
significant during the year, and those outstanding at January 31, 1997 were
insignificant to the Company's financial position. The Company minimizes its
exposure to the risk of devaluation of foreign currencies by operating in
local currencies and through buying forward contracts on some known
transactions.

Forward-Looking Statements
     Certain statements contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and
elsewhere in this annual report are forward-looking statements. These
statements discuss, among other things, expected growth, future revenues and
future performance. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, competitive pressures,
inflation, consumer debt levels, currency exchange fluctuations, trade
restrictions, changes in tariff and freight rates, capital market conditions
and other risks indicated in the Company's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Actual results may materially differ from anticipated
results described in these statements.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Segment Information
The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation of
mass merchandising stores located in all 50 states, Argentina, Canada and Puerto
Rico, and through joint ventures in Brazil, China and Mexico.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
Inventories are stated principally at cost (last-in, first-out), which is not in
excess of market, using the retail method for inventories in Wal-Mart stores and
Supercenters.

Pre-opening Costs
Costs associated with the opening of stores are expensed during the first full
month of operations. The costs are carried as prepaid expenses prior to the
store opening.

Interest during Construction
In order that interest costs properly reflect only that portion relating to
current operations, interest on borrowed funds during the construction of
property, plant and equipment is capitalized. Interest costs capitalized were
$44 million, $50 million and $70 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes is provided on
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various assets.
For income tax purposes, accelerated methods are used with recognition of
deferred income taxes for the resulting temporary differences.

Long-Lived Assets
In fiscal 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of." The statement requires entities to review long-lived
assets and certain intangible assets in certain circumstances, and if the value
of the assets is impaired, an impairment loss shall be recognized. Due to the
Company's previous accounting policies, this pronouncement had no material
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Operating, Selling and General and Administrative Expenses
Buying, warehousing and occupancy costs are included in operating, selling and
general and administrative expenses.

Net Income per Share
Net income per share is based on the weighted average outstanding common shares.
The dilutive effect of stock options is insignificant and consequently has been
excluded from the earnings per share computations.

Stock Options
Proceeds from the sale of common stock issued under the stock option plans and
related tax benefits which accrue to the Company are accounted for as capital
transactions, and no charges or credits are made to income in connection with
the plans.

Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

2  Commercial Paper and Long-Term Debt

Information on short-term borrowings and interest rates is as follows (dollar

At January 31, 1997, the Company had committed lines of credit of $2,450 million
with 34 banks and informal lines of credit with various banks totaling an
additional $2,450 million, which were used to support short-term borrowings and
commercial paper. Short-term borrowings under these lines of credit bear
interest at or below the prime rate.

The Company has agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of its note
and debenture agreements, the most restrictive of which relates to amounts of
additional secured debt and long-term leases.

The Company has entered into sale/leaseback transactions involving buildings
while retaining title to the underlying land.

These transactions were accounted for as financings and are included in long-
term debt and the annual maturities schedules above. The resulting obligations
are amortized over the lease terms. Future minimum lease payments for each of
the five succeeding years as of January 31, 1997 are (in millions):

Thereafter                              915
</TABLE>

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt approximates $7,836 million 
based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of
borrowing arrangements.

At January 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had letters of credit outstanding
totaling $811 million and $551 million, respectively. These letters of credit
were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory.

Under shelf registration statements previously filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission the Company may issue debt securities aggregating $751
million.

The Company has entered into an interest rate swap on an obligation which
amortizes through 2006.

The Company swapped a fixed rate of 6.97% for a variable short-term rate on a
notional amount of $630 million amortizing down to $203 million with semi 
annual settlements. The variable rate was 5.45% at the last settlement. This 
interest rate swap is accounted for by recording the net interest received or
paid as an adjustment to interest expense on a current basis. Gains or losses 
resulting from market movements are not recognized. An increase in short term 
rates would cause the Company an insignificant additional interest cost.

3  Defined Contribution Plan

The Company maintains a profit sharing plan under which most full and many 
part-time Associates become participants following one year of employment. 
Annual contributions, based on the profitability of the Company, are made at 
the sole discretion of the Company. Contributions were $247 million, $204 
million and $175 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

5  Acquisitions

In fiscal 1995, the Company acquired selected assets related to 122 Woolco
stores in Canada from Woolworth Canada, Inc., a subsidiary of Woolworth
Corporation, for approximately $352 million, recording $221 million of 
leasehold and location value which is being amortized over 20 years.

This transaction has been accounted for as a purchase. The results of 
operations for the acquired units since the dates of their acquisitions have
been included in the Company's results. Pro forma results of operations are 
not presented due to the insignificant differences from the historical results.

6  Stock Option Plans

At January 31, 1997, 74 million shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance under stock option plans. The options  granted under the stock option
plans expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted prior to November
17, 1995, may be exercised in nine annual installments. Options granted on or
after November 17, 1995, may be exercised in seven annual installments. The
Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) and related Interpretations
in accounting for its employee stock options because the alternative fair value
accounting provided under FASB Statement 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," requires the use of option valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the
exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized. The effect of applying the fair value method of Statement 123 to 
the Company's option plan would result in net income and net income per share 
that are not materially different from the amounts reported in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

Further information concerning the options is as follows:

Present value of minimum lease payments                           $ 2,402


Certain of the leases provide for contingent additional rentals based on
percentage of sales. Such additional rentals amounted to $51 million, $41
million and $42 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Substantially all
of the store leases have renewal options for additional terms from five to 25
years at comparable rentals.

The Company has entered into lease commitments for land and buildings for 30
future locations. These lease commitments with real estate developers provide
for minimum rentals for 20 years, excluding renewal options. If consummated
based on current cost estimates, they will approximate $27 million annually 
over the lease terms.
