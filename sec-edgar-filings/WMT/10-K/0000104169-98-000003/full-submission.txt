      This  Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to  be
"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of the Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act  of 1995. Statements included  or  incorporated  by
reference   in  this  Form  10-K  which  address  activities,   events   or
developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may  occur  in
the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including
the  amount and nature thereof), expansion and other development trends  of
industry  segments  in  which  the Company is  active,  business  strategy,
expansion  and  growth of the Company's business and operations  and  other
such  matters are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes
the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based  on
reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its  business,
a  number  of factors could cause actual results to differ materially  from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written,
made  by or on behalf of the Company. Many of these factors have previously
been  identified  in  filings or statements made by or  on  behalf  of  the
Company.

     All  phases  of  the  Company's operations are subject  to  influences
outside  its  control. Any one, or a combination, of  these  factors  could
materially  affect the results of the Company's operations.  These  factors
include: the cost of goods, competitive pressures, inflation, consumer debt
levels,  currency  exchange fluctuations, trade  restrictions,  changes  in
tariff  and  freight rates, interest rate fluctuations  and  other  capital
market  conditions. Forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of  the
Company  are  based on a knowledge of its business and the  environment  in
which  it operates, but because of the factors listed above, actual results
may  differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, all
of  the  forward-looking statements made are qualified by these  and  other
cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results
or  developments anticipated by the Company will be realized  or,  even  if
substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or
effects on the Company or its business or operations.

                           WAL-MART STORES, INC.
                          FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT
                    FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 1998
                                     
                                  PART I
                                     
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

      Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together with its subsidiaries  hereinafter
referred  to  as  the  "Company") is the United  States'  largest  retailer
measured by total revenues.  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998,
the Company had net sales of $117,958,000,000.

          (a)  Historical Development of Business

           Domestically,  at January 31, 1998, the Company  operated  1,921
discount  stores  and  441  Supercenters, and 443  Sam's  Clubs.   A  table
summarizing  information concerning additions of units and  square  footage
for  domestic  discount stores, Supercenters and Sam's Clubs since  January
31,  1993,  is included as Schedule A to Item I found on page  11  of  this
annual report.

           During  fiscal  1998,  a  merger of the  Mexican  joint  venture
companies owned by the Company and Cifra, S.A. de C.V. ("Cifra")  with  and
into  Cifra  was consummated with an effective merger date of September  1,
1997.   The  Company received voting shares of Cifra equaling approximately
33.5%  of  the  outstanding  voting shares of Cifra  in  exchange  for  the
Company's  joint venture interests.  The Company then acquired  593,100,000
shares  of  the  Series "A" Common Shares and Series "B" Common  Shares  of
Cifra  in a cash tender offer. As a result of the merger and tender  offer,
the  Company  holds approximately 51% of the outstanding voting  shares  of
Cifra.  The results of operations for Cifra since the effective merger date
are  included  in  the Company's results.  Prior to the merger,  the  joint
venture units controlled by the Company were consolidated while those units
controlled by Cifra were accounted for under the equity method.  See Note 6
of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in
Item  8  of  Part II found on page 16 of this annual report for  additional
information  regarding  our  acquisitions.   At  January  31,  1998,  Cifra
operated  28  warehouse  clubs, 27 Supercenters, 36 Superamas  (traditional
supermarkets),  62  Bodegas  (discount stores),  33  Aurreras  (combination
stores  including  both  general merchandise  and  grocery),  38  Suburbias
(specialty department stores) and 178 Vips (restaurants) throughout Mexico.

           In  fiscal  1998,  the  Company's  subsidiary,  Wal-Mart  Brasil
Participacoes S.A. acquired the 40% interest of its minority joint  venture
partner,  Lojas Americanas S.A.(Lojas). On the same day that  the  minority
interest  was  acquired, a 5% minority interest was sold to Carlos  Alberto
Sicupira,  a  principal  in  Banco de Investimentos  Garantia  S.A.,  which
indirectly controls Lojas, at the same price per share at which Lojas  sold
its  minority  interest.  Because the transaction closed  on  December  30,
1997,  which was the joint venture's fiscal year end, the Company's results
of  operations  for fiscal 1998 include only the financial results  of  the
joint  venture attributable to the Company's original ownership percentage.
See  Note  6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated  by

</PAGE 3>

<PAGE 4>

reference  in Item 8 of Part II found on page 16 of this annual report  for
additional information regarding our acquisitions.

           In  fiscal  1998, the Company along with joint-venture  partner,
Dongguan  Donghu  Industrial Corporation, added one unit  in  the  People's
Republic of China.  With the addition of this unit, at January 31, 1998, we
operated three units under various joint venture agreements in the People's
Republic of China.

           In  fiscal  1998, the Company acquired the Wertkauf  hypermarket
chain  in  Germany,  as  well  as certain real  estate.   The  21  acquired
hypermarkets are one-stop shopping centers that offer a broad assortment of
high  quality general merchandise and food and are similar to the  Wal-Mart
Supercenter format in the United States. The transaction closed on December
30,  1997,  Wertkauf's fiscal year end. Therefore, the acquired assets  are
included  in  the  January 31, 1998, consolidated  balance  sheet  and  the
results of operations will be included beginning in fiscal 1999. See Note 6
of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in
Item  8  of  Part II found on page 16 of this annual report for  additional
information  regarding our acquisitions. At January 31, 1998,  the  Company
operated 21 hypermarkets in Germany.

           Internationally, at January 31, 1998, we operated nine units  in
Argentina,  eight  units  in Brazil, 144 units in Canada,  three  units  in
China,  21  units  in Germany, 402 units in Mexico and 14 units  in  Puerto
Rico.   A  table summarizing information concerning additions of units  and
square  footage  for  international units operated  since  fiscal  1993  is
included as Schedule B to Item 1 found on page 12 of this annual report.

          (b)  Financial information about the Company's industry segments

           The  Company  is  principally engaged in the operation  of  mass
merchandising  stores  which  serve our  customers  primarily  through  the
operation of three segments.

           In  June  1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB)
issued Statement No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise  and
Related  Information," which the Company has adopted in the  current  year.
We  identify  our  segments based on management responsibility  within  the
United States and geographically for all international units.  The Wal-Mart
Stores  segment includes the Company's discount stores and Supercenters  in
the United States. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership
clubs  in  the  United  States.  The  international  segment  includes  all
operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico and  Puerto
Rico.   For the financial results of the Company's operating segments,  see
Note  9  of  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements  incorporated  by
reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page 16 of this annual report.

          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

          The Company, a Delaware corporation, has its principal offices in
Bentonville,  Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated  in  October
1969,  the businesses conducted by its predecessors began in 1945 when  Sam
M.  Walton  opened  a  franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in  Newport,

</PAGE 4>

<PAGE 5>

Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in
Versailles,  Missouri.   Until  1962, the Company's  business  was  devoted
entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first  Wal-
Mart  Discount  City  (discount store) was opened.   In  fiscal  1984,  the
Company  opened its first three Sam's Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its  first
Wal-Mart   Supercenter  (combination  full-line  supermarket  and  discount
store).   In  fiscal  1992,  the  Company  began  its  first  international
initiative when the Company entered into a joint venture in which it had  a
50%  interest  with  Cifra.  Our international presence  has  continued  to
expand  and  at  January 31, 1998, we had operations in six  countries  and
Puerto Rico.

WAL-MART STORES OPERATING SEGMENT

          The Wal-Mart Stores segment which includes the Company's discount
stores  and Supercenters in the United States had sales of $83,820,000,000,
$74,840,000,000 and $66,271,000,000 for the three years ended  January  31,
1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year,  no
single discount store or Supercenter location accounted for as much  as  1%
of  total  Company sales or net income. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part  II  found
on  page 16 of this annual report for additional information regarding  our
segments.

           General.  We operate Wal-Mart discount stores in all 50  states.
The  average size of a discount store is approximately 93,400 square  feet.
Wal-Mart  Supercenters are located in 28 states and the average size  of  a
Supercenter  is  182,200 square feet. Our Supercenter prototypes  range  in
size from 110,000 square feet to 234,000 square feet.

            Merchandise.    Wal-Mart  discount  stores  and   the   general
merchandise  area  of  the  Supercenters are generally  organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys and infants.  Each store also carries  domestics,
fabrics  and  notions,  stationery and books, shoes, housewares,  hardware,
electronics,  home  furnishings, small appliances, automotive  accessories,
horticulture   and  accessories,  sporting  goods,  toys,  pet   food   and
accessories,  cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals
and  jewelry.  In  addition,  the stores offer  an  assortment  of  grocery
merchandise,  with  the  assortment  in  Supercenters  being  broader   and
including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  in the stores. The Company markets lines of merchandise under  store
brands  including but not limited to "Sam's American Choice", "One Source",
"Great  Value", "Ol' Roy" and "Equate". The Company also markets  lines  of
merchandise  under  licensed brands; some of which include  "Faded  Glory",
"Kathie  Lee", "White Stag", "Better Homes & Gardens", "Popular Mechanics",
"Catalina", "McKids", "Basic Equipment" and "House Beautiful".

           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998, sales in discount
stores and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product
category were as follows:

                                                  100%

           Operations.  Hours of operations vary by location, but generally
range from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m.  to
8:00 p.m. on Sunday for discount stores and Supercenters.  In addition,  an
increasing number of discount stores and almost all of the Supercenters are
open 24 hours each day.  Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain
uniform  prices,  except  where lower prices are necessary  to  meet  local
competition.   Sales are primarily on a self-service, cash-and-carry  basis
with  the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while
minimizing expenses.  Bank credit card programs, operated without  recourse
to the Company, are available in all stores.

           Seasonal  Aspects of Operations.  The Wal-Mart Stores  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.   Our discount stores compete with other  discount,
department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are  national
chains.  The  Wal-Mart  Supercenters compete  with  other  supercenter-type
stores,  discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of  which
are  national  or regional chains.  As of January 31, 1998,  based  on  net
sales, the Wal-Mart Stores segment ranked first among all retail department
store chains and among all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers.  The
Company  has  many programs designed to meet the competitive needs  of  its
industry.  These include "Everyday Low Price", "Item Merchandising", "Store-
Within-a-Store" and "Buy America" programs.  Although the Company  believes
it  has  had a major influence in most of the retail markets in  which  its
stores are located, there is no assurance that this will continue.

           Distribution.  During the 1998 fiscal year, approximately 83% of
the Wal-Mart discount stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped from

</PAGE 6>

<PAGE 7>

Wal-Mart's 38 distribution centers, seven of which are grocery distribution
centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly  to  the
stores   from  suppliers.  The  38  centers  are  located  throughout   the
continental United States. Five distribution centers are located in each of
Arkansas  and  Texas; three in South Carolina; two in each  of  California,
Florida,  Indiana, Mississippi and New York; and one in  each  of  Alabama,
Colorado,  Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire,  North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Each
distribution  center serves the distribution needs of approximately  80  to
100  stores,  depending  on  the size of the  center.  The  size  of  these
distribution centers ranges from approximately 600,000 to 1,700,000  square
feet.

SAM'S CLUB OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  Sam's  Club segment which includes the warehouse membership
clubs  in  the  United States had sales of $20,668,000,000, $19,785,000,000
and  $19,068,000,000 for the three years ended January 31, 1998, 1997,  and
1996,  respectively.  During the most recent fiscal year,  no  single  club
location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net  income.
See  Note  9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated  by
reference  in Item 8 of Part II found on page 16 of this annual report  for
additional information regarding our segments.

           General.  The  Company operates Sam's Clubs in 48  states.   The
average size of a Sam's Club is approximately 120,900 square feet, and club
sizes  generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet  of  building
area.

           Merchandise.  Sam's offers bulk displays of name brand  hardgood
merchandise,  some  softgoods and institutional size grocery  items.   Each
Sam's  also carries software and electronic goods, jewelry, sporting goods,
toys,  tires, stationery and books.  Most clubs have fresh food departments
which include bakery, meat and produce.

          Operations.  Operating hours vary among Sam's Clubs, but they are
generally  open  Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30  p.m.   Most
Sam's  are  open  Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and on  Sunday  from
11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

           Sam's  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "Sam's Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.  Any credit issued under these programs is without recourse to the
Company.   Club  members include businesses and those individuals  who  are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees  and  credit union members.  In fiscal 1998,  both  business  and
individual  members paid an annual membership fee of $25  for  the  primary
membership  card  with  a  spouse card available  for  an  additional  $10.
Beginning  in fiscal 1999, the annual membership fee for a business  member
increased  to  $30  for  the primary membership card  with  a  spouse  card

</PAGE 7>

<PAGE 8>

available  at  no  additional  cost.  The  annual  membership  fee  for  an
individual member increased to $35 for the primary membership card  with  a
spouse card available at no additional cost.

            Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  Sam's  Club  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  Sam's Clubs compete with warehouse clubs, as  well
as  with  discount  retailers, wholesale grocers  and  general  merchandise
wholesalers and distributors. The Company also competes with others for new
store  sites.  As of January 31, 1998, based on net sales, the  Sam's  Club
segment ranked second among all warehouse clubs.

          Distribution.  During fiscal 1998, approximately 60% of the Sam's
Club  purchases were shipped from distribution facilities, eight  of  which
are  food distribution facilities. The balance was shipped directly to  the
clubs  from  suppliers.   A  combination  of  Company  owned  and  operated
facilities  and  third-party facilities comprises the overall  distribution
structure.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  International Segment includes operations of the  Company's
wholly-owned  subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Germany and  Puerto  Rico,
joint  ventures  in  China and majority-owned subsidiaries  in  Brazil  and
Mexico.   Sales for the three years ended January 31, 1998, 1997, and  1996
were   $7,517,000,000,  $5,002,000,000  and  $3,712,000,000,  respectively.
During  the  most recent fiscal year, no single location accounted  for  as
much  as  1% of total Company sales or net income. See Note 9 of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in  Item  8  of
Part  II  found on page 16 of this annual report for additional information
regarding our segments.

          General.  Operating formats vary by country, but include Wal-Mart
discount  stores  in  Canada  and Puerto Rico; Supercenters  in  Argentina,
Brazil, Mexico and under joint venture agreements in China; Sam's Clubs  in
Argentina,  Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico and under joint venture  agreements
in  China;  Hypermarkets  in  Germany  and  Superamas,  Bodegas,  Aurreras,
Suburbias and Vips in Mexico.

           Merchandise.    The merchandising strategy in the  International
operating  segment is similar to that of domestic segments in  the  breadth
and  scope  of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name  merchandise
accounts  for  a majority of sales, several store brands not found  in  the
United  States  have  been developed to serve customers  in  the  different
markets  in  which the International segment operates.  In addition,  steps
have been taken to develop relationships with local vendors in each country
to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

          Operations.  The hours of operation for operating units in the
international division vary by country and by individual markets within

</PAGE 8>

<PAGE 9>

countries depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of
operation.  While sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit
cards or other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to
facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The International  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of  sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter.  The seasonality  of
the  business  varies  by country due to different national  and  religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

          Competition.  The International operating segment competes with a
variety of local national and international chains in the discount,
department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail
market.  The segment's competitive position is determined, to a large
extent, by its ability to offer its customers everyday low prices on
quality merchandise that offers exceptional value.  In Supercenters, our
ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact on
the segment's  competitive position in the markets where we operate.

            Distribution.    The  International  segment  operates   export
consolidation  facilities  in  Miami,  Florida;  Seattle,  Washington;  and
Laredo,  Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and  Latin
American  markets.   In addition, distribution facilities  are  located  in
Argentina,  Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico which process  and  flow  both
imported  and domestic product to the operating units.  Operationally,  the
principle  focus  is  on  crossdocking product,  while  maintaining  stored
inventory  is  minimized.   During fiscal 1998, approximately  70%  of  the
International  merchandise  purchases  flowed  through  these  distribution
facilities.  The balance was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers.
A  combination  of  Company owned and operated facilities  and  third-party
facilities  comprises the overall distribution  structure for International
logistics.

governmental  entity  through an industrial revenue bond  transaction.   All  of
the  Company's  leases  for  its stores provide for fixed  annual  rentals  and,
in   many  cases,  the  leases  provide  for  additional  rent  based  on  sales
volume.

facilities  and  19  McLane  distribution  facilities  at  January   31,   1998.
These   distribution  facilities  are  primarily  owned  by  the  Company,   and
several  are  subject  to  mortgage secured loans.   Some  of  the  distribution
facilities   are   leased   under   industrial   development   bond    financing
arrangements  and  provide  the option of purchasing  these  facilities  at  the
end of the lease term for nominal amounts.

           The  Company  owns  office facilities in Bentonville,  Arkansas  that
serve  as  the  home  office  for the Company and owns  an  office  facility  in
Temple, Texas which serves as the home office for McLane.

1997 Amendment to the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Option Plan of 1994

The language of Section 10 of the Stock Option Plan is hereby stricken
and the following language is hereby inserted:

     STOCK  OPTION  GRANTS:  Records maintained by  the  Stock  option
     Department and the minutes of the Stock Option Committee and  the
     minutes  of the Compensation and Nominating Committee for Section
     16  officers shall be conclusive evidence of the grant  of  stock

Paragraph of Section 8:

     EXERCISE  OF OPTION RIGHTS UPON TERMINATION OF {OR ADMINISTRATIVE
     SUSPENSION  FROM} EMPLOYMENT OR CESSATION AS A FULL-TIME  OFFICER
     OR  ELIGIBLE  KEY EMPLOYEE:  If an Optionee (i) whose  employment
     with the Company and/or one of its Subsidiaries is terminated for
     any reason other that death, or (ii) ceases for any reason to  be
     a  full-time  officer or eligible key employee as  determined  by
     Committee in its discretion, then such Optionee may exercise  his
     or  her  option,  to the extent exercisable as of  the  date  the
     Optionee's employment is terminated or such Optionee ceases to be
     a  full-time  officer or an eligible key employee,  whichever  is
     earlier,  at  any time within three months after the  earlier  of
     such dates, but in no event may an option be exercised after  the
     expiration of the term of the option; provided, however, that  if
     the  Optionee's  employment shall be terminated for  cause,  said
     option shall terminate immediately. As used herein, "cause" shall
     mean  the  commission  of any act deemed  inimical  to  the  best
     interest  of the Company as determined at the sole discretion  of
     the Committee. {During a period of administrative suspension, the
     Optionee's  right  to  exercise options  is  suspended  and  will
     terminate if the Optionee is terminated for cause.}

</TABLE>

     The  Company  sales growth of 12% in fiscal 1998, when compared  to  fiscal
1997,  was  attributable  to our expansion program and comparative  store  sales
increases  of 6%. Expansion for fiscal 1998 included the opening of 37  Wal-Mart
stores, 97 Supercenters  (including the conversion of 75 Wal-Mart stores), eight
SAM'S  Club  units  and  the opening or acquisition of 289 international  units.
International  sales accounted for approximately 6.4% of total sales  in  fiscal
1998 compared with 4.8% in fiscal 1997. The growth in International is partially
due  to the acquisition of controlling interest in Cifra, S.A de C.V. during the
third  quarter.  See  Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements  for
additional information on our acquisitions. SAM'S Club sales, as a percentage of
total sales, decreased from 18.9% in fiscal 1997 to 17.5% in fiscal 1998.
     The  sales  increase  in  fiscal 1997 when  compared  to  fiscal  1996  was
attributable  to our expansion program and comparative store sales increases  of
5%.  Expansion for fiscal 1997 included the opening of 59 Wal-Mart  stores,  105
Supercenters (including the conversion of 92 Wal-Mart stores), nine  SAM'S  Club
units  and  38 international units. The majority of the sales increase  resulted
from  Wal-Mart  stores  and  Supercenters  while  international  sales  grew  to
approximately 4.8% of the total sales in fiscal 1997 from 4.0% in  fiscal  1996.
SAM'S Club sales, as a percentage of total sales, decreased from 20.4% in fiscal
1996 to 18.9% in fiscal 1997.

Costs and Expenses
     Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, decreased .4% in fiscal 1998  when
compared  to  fiscal 1997 and increased .1% in fiscal 1997, when  compared  with
fiscal  1996. The decrease in fiscal 1998 resulted from improvements in the  mix
of merchandise sold and from better inventory management. Operating efficiencies
and the strong emphasis placed on inventory management has reduced markdowns and
shrinkage.  Approximately .1% of the decrease in cost of sales was a  result  of
the  sales  contribution of SAM'S Club. As its sales became a smaller percentage
of  total  Company sales, the cost of sales is positively impacted  since  their
gross margin contribution is lower than the stores. The increase in fiscal  1997
when  compared to fiscal 1996 is due in part to one-time markdowns in the  third
quarter resulting from a strategic decision to reduce the merchandise assortment
in selected categories. Cost of sales also increased approximately .3% due to  a
larger  percentage of consolidated sales from departments within Wal-Mart stores
which  have  lower markon percents, and to our continuing commitment  of  always
providing  low prices. These increases were offset by approximately .2%  because
SAM'S Club comprised a lower percentage of consolidated sales in 1997 at a lower
contribution to gross margin than Wal-Mart stores.
     Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased .3%, as a
percentage  of  sales, in fiscal 1998 when compared with fiscal 1997,  and  were
flat  in  fiscal  1997 when compared to fiscal 1996. Approximately  .2%  of  the
increase  in  fiscal  1998 was due to increases in payroll and  related  benefit
costs.  Additionally, a contributing factor in the increase for the  year  is  a
charge of $50 million for closing the majority of the Bud's Discount City stores
during the second quarter of fiscal 1998. This charge was reflected in operating
income  due  to  its immateriality to our results of operations and  because  we
continue to operate eight Bud's Discount City stores. In fiscal 1997, operating,
selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately .1% due  to
a  lower  expense to sales percentage at SAM'S Club compared to Wal-Mart Stores.
This  increase  was  offset through expense control  in  all  of  the  operating
formats.
     Historically,  computer software has been programmed  to  make  assumptions
about  the century when given a date that only uses two digits to represent  the
year.  Although these assumptions have been perfectly acceptable  the  past  few
decades, they are potential cause for concern for software used in the year 2000
and beyond. Specifically,this abbreviated date format makes it difficult for  an
application or computer user to distinguish between dates starting with 19xx and
20xx.  The  Company has initiated a project to address the year 2000  compliance
issue  for technology hardware, software and equipment. The assessment phase  of
our  project  is  substantially  complete. The majority  of  the  compliance  is
expected  to  be  performed  by Company associates.  Approximately  67%  of  the
required  conversions  have  occurred. We anticipate  completing  all  remaining
conversions  during fiscal 1999. The total estimated cost of the  conversion  is
$12  million,  which is being expensed as incurred. The cost of the  conversions
and the completion dates are based on management's best estimates and may be u
pdated  as additional information becomes available. In addition, communications
are ongoing with other companies with which our systems interface or rely on  to
determine  the  extent to which those companies are addressing their  year  2000
compliance.

Interest Costs
     Interest  costs  decreased  in fiscal 1998  compared  to  fiscal  1997  due
primarily  to  lower short-term borrowings. Enhanced operating  cash  flows  and
lower  capital  spending enabled the Company to meet cash  requirements  without
short-term  borrowings throughout most of fiscal 1998. Interest costs  decreased
in  fiscal  1997  compared to fiscal 1996 due to lower average daily  short-term
borrowings  and  through retirement of maturing debt. See Note  2  of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements for additional information  on  interest  and
debt.

Market Risk
     Market  risks  relating to the Company's operations result  primarily  from
changes  in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates. We enter  into
interest rate swaps to minimize the risk and costs associated with our financial
activities.  The  swap agreements are contracts to exchange  fixed  or  variable
rates  for  floating interest rate payments periodically over the  life  of  the
instruments.
     The  following  table provides information about our  derivative  financial
instruments  and other financial instruments that are sensitive  to  changes  in
interest  rates. For debt obligations, the table presents principal  cash  flows
and related weighted-aver
age  interest  rates by expected maturity dates. For interest  rate  swaps,  the
table  presents  notional  amounts and average  interest  rates  by  contractual
maturity  dates. For variable rate instruments, we have indicated the applicable
floating rate index.

    The Company routinely enters into forward currency exchange contracts in the
regular  course  of  business to manage its exposure  against  foreign  currency
fluctuations  on  inventory purchases denominated in foreign  currencies.  These
contracts  are for short durations, generally less than six months. In addition,
we have entered into a foreign currency swap to hedge our investment in Germany.
Under  the  agreement, the Company will pay 1,960 million in German Deutschmarks
in 2003 and will receive $1,101 million in United States Dollars.
     The  following  table  provides information about the Company's  derivative
financial  instruments, including foreign currency forward  exchange  agreements
and currency swap agreements by functional currency and presents the information
in  U.S.  dollar equivalents. For foreign currency forward exchange  agreements,

International Operations
     A  portion  of  our  operations consists of  sales  activities  in  foreign
jurisdictions. We operate wholly owned operations in Argentina, Canada,  Germany
and  Puerto  Rico,  through joint ventures in China and  through  majority-owned
subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico. As a result, our financial results  could  be
affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or  weak
economic  conditions in the foreign markets in which we do business. We minimize
the  exposure  to the risk of devaluation of foreign currencies by operating  in
local  currencies and through buying forward contracts, where feasible, on known
transactions.
     All  foreign  operations are measured in their local  currencies  with  the
exception  of Brazil and Mexico, which operate in highly-inflationary  economies
and  report operations using U.S. Dollars. Beginning in fiscal 1999, Brazil will
no  longer  be considered a highly-inflationary economy and will begin reporting
its  operations  in  its local currency. In fiscal 1998,  the  foreign  currency
translation adjustment increased by $73 million to $473 million primarily due to
the  exchange  rate in Canada. In fiscal 1997, the foreign currency  translation
adjustment decreased by $12 million to $400 million primarily due to a favorable
exchange  rate in Canada. The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment
of $412 million in fiscal 1996 was due primarily to operations in Mexico.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows Information
     Cash flows from operating activities were $7,123 million in fiscal 1998, up
from $5,930 million in fiscal 1997. In fiscal 1998, the Company  invested $2,636
million in capital assets and paid dividends of $611 million and had a net  cash
outlay  of   $1,865 million for acquisitions. Acquisitions include the  Wertkauf
hypermarket  chain in Germany, a controlling interest in Cifra, S.A.  de  C.  V.
(Cifra)  and  the  minority interest in our Brazilian joint venture  from  Lojas
Americanas.  See  Note  6  of  Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for
additional information on our acquisitions.

Company Stock Purchase and Common Stock Dividends
     In  fiscal  1998, the Company repurchased over  47 million  shares  of  its
common  stock  for  $1.6 billion. Subsequent to January 31,  1998,  the  Company
announced plans to repurchase up to $2 billion of its common stock over the next
12  to  18 months. Additionally, the Company increased the dividend 15% to  $.31
per share for fiscal 1999.

Borrowing Information
     The Company had committed lines of credit with 77 banks, aggregating $1,873
million  and  informal  lines of credit with various other  banks,  totaling  an
additional $1,950 million,  which were used to support short-term borrowing  and
commercial paper. These lines of credit and their anticipated cyclical increases
will  be  sufficient to finance the seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories
and for other cash requirements.
     We anticipate generating sufficient operating cash flow to fund all capital
expenditures and our Company stock repurchase program. Accordingly,  we  do  not
plan  to finance future capital expenditures with debt. However,  we do plan  to
refinance  existing  long-term  debt as it matures  and  may  desire  to  obtain
additional long-term financing for other uses of cash or for strategic  reasons.
We  anticipate  no difficulty in obtaining long-term financing in  view  of  our
excellent  credit  rating and favorable experiences in the debt  market  in  the
recent  past. In addition to the available credit lines mentioned above, we  may
sell  up  to $251 million of public debt under shelf registration statements  on
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Expansion
     Domestically,  we  plan to open approximately 50 new  Wal-Mart  stores  and
between 120 and 125 new Supercenters. Approximately 90 of the Supercenters  will
come  from  relocations or expansions of existing Wal-Mart stores. Also  planned
for  next  fiscal  year  are  ten new SAM'S Club units  and  three  distribution
centers. Internationally, plans are to develop 50 to 60 new retail units.  These
stores  are  planned  in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany,  Mexico  and
Puerto  Rico.  Total planned growth represents approximately 26  million  square
feet of additional retail space.
     Total  planned capital expenditures for fiscal 1999 approximate $4 billion.
We plan to finance our expansion primarily with operating cash flows.

Forward-Looking Statements
     Certain  statements contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis,  and
elsewhere   in  this  annual  report,  are  forward-looking  statements.   These
statements  discuss,  among other things, expected growth, future  revenues  and
future  performance.  The forward-looking statements are subject  to  risks  and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, competitive pressures,  inflation,
consumer  debt  levels,  currency  exchange  fluctuations,  trade  restrictions,
changes  in tariff and freight rates, capital market conditions and other  risks
indicated  in  our  filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Actual
results  may  materially  differ from anticipated  results  described  in  these
statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and cash equivalents
     The  Company considers investments with a maturity of three months or  less
when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Inventories
     The  Company uses the retail last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for  domestic
Wal-Mart  discount  stores  and Supercenters and  cost  LIFO  for  SAM'S  Clubs.
International  inventories are on other cost methods.  Inventories  are  not  in
excess of market value.

Pre-opening costs
     Costs  associated with the opening of stores are expensed during the  first
full month of operations. The costs are carried as prepaid expenses prior to the
store  opening. If the Company had expensed these costs as incurred, net  income
would have been reduced by $2 million, $9 million and $2 million in fiscal 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.

Interest during construction
     In order that interest costs properly reflect only that portion relating to
current  operations,  interest  on borrowed funds  during  the  construction  of
property,  plant  and equipment is capitalized. Interest costs capitalized  were
$33 million, $44 million and $50 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Financial instruments
     The  Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes other  than
trading  to  reduce  its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies  and  to
minimize  the  risk  and  cost associated with financial  and  global  operating
activities.  Settlements of interest rate swaps are accounted for  by  recording
the  net  interest received or paid as an adjustment to interest  expense  on  a
current  basis.  Gains  or  losses  resulting  from  market  movements  are  not
recognized.  Contracts  that  effectively meet risk  reduction  and  correlation
criteria  are  recorded using hedge accounting. Hedges of  firm  commitments  or
anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized when the hedged transaction
occurs.

Advertising costs
     Advertising  costs  are expensed as incurred and were  $292  million,  $249
million and $219 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Operating, selling and general and administrative expenses
     Buying, warehousing and occupancy costs are included in operating,  selling
and general and administrative expenses.

Depreciation and amortization
     Depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided
on  the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives  of  the  various
assets.  For  income tax purposes, accelerated methods are used with recognition
of deferred income taxes for the resulting temporary differences.
Estimated useful lives are as follows:

  Building and improvements        5-33 years
  Fixtures and equipment           5-12 years
  Transportation equipment          2-5 years
  Goodwill                        20-40 years

Long-lived assets
     In  fiscal  1997,  the  Company adopted Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  and  for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. The statement requires entities  to  review
long-lived assets and certain intangible assets in certain circumstances, and if
the value of the assets is impaired, an impairment loss shall be recognized. Due
to  the  Company's  previous  accounting policies,  this  pronouncement  had  no
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Comprehensive income
     In  June  1997,  the  Financial Accounting Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued
Statement  No.  130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which  is  effective  for
fiscal  years  beginning  after December 15, 1997.  This  statement  establishes
standards  for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components.
The  Company  anticipates  adopting this Statement in fiscal  1999.  Since  this
Statement  requires only additional disclosure, there will be no effect  on  the
Company's results of operations or financial position.

Net income per share
     In  fiscal  1998,  the  Company adopted Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Statement 128 replaces primary and  fully
dilutive  earnings per share with basic and dilutive earnings per share.  Unlike
primary  earnings  per  share, basic earnings per share  excludes  any  dilutive
effect  of options. Basic earnings per share for all periods presented  are  the
same as previously reported. Basic net income per share is based on the weighted
average outstanding common shares. Dilutive net income per share is based on the
weighted average outstanding shares reduced by the effect of stock options.
     The shares used in the computations for basic and dilutive   net income per
share are as follows (in millions):

                                   1998     1997       1996
  Basic                           2,258    2,292      2,296
  Dilutive                        2,267    2,296      2,299


          Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Annual Report - Page 31

Foreign currency translation
     The  assets and liabilities of most foreign subsidiaries are translated  at
current  exchange rates and any related translation adjustments are recorded  in
Consolidated  Shareholders' Equity. Operations in Brazil and Mexico  operate  in
highly  inflationary economies and certain assets are translated  at  historical
exchange rates and all translation adjustments are reflected in the Consolidated
Income Statements.

Estimates and assumptions
     The  preparation  of consolidated financial statements in  conformity  with
generally  accepted accounting principles requires management to make  estimates
and assumptions. These estimates and  assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets  and  liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at
the  date  of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts  of
revenues  and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could  differ
from those estimates.

Reclassifications
     Certain  reclassifications have been made to prior periods  to  conform  to
current presentation.

     At  January  31,  1998  and  1997,  there  were  no  short-term  borrowings
outstanding. At January 31, 1998, the Company had committed lines of  credit  of
$1,873  million  with 77 banks and informal lines of credit with  various  banks
totaling  an  additional $1,950 million, which were used to  support  short-term
borrowings  and  commercial paper. Short-term borrowings under  these  lines  of
credit bear interest at or below the prime rate.

    Long-term debt at January 31, consists of (amounts in millions):

     In  fiscal  1998, the Company borrowed $500 million due in  2010  with  put
options  imbedded.  Beginning in 2000, and every second year,  thereafter  until
2010, the holders of the debt may require the Company to repurchase the debt  at
face value.
    Long-term debt is unsecured except for $202 million, which is collateralized
by  property  with  an aggregate carrying value of approximately  $349  million.
Annual  maturities  of  long-term  debt during  the  next  five  years  are  (in
millions):

     The Company has agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of  its
note agreements, the most restrictive of which, relates to amounts of additional
secured debt and long-term leases.
     The  Company  has  entered  into  sale/leaseback  transactions    involving
buildings while retaining title to the undering land.
    These transactions were accounted for as financings and are included in
long-term  debt  and the annual maturities schedules above. The resulting
obligations are  amortized over the lease terms. Future minimum lease payments
for  each  of the five succeeding years, as of January 31, 1998, are

     At January 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had letters of credit outstanding
totaling  $673 million and $811 million, respectively. These letters  of  credit
were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory.
    Under shelf registration statements previously filed with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission,  the  Company may issue debt securities  aggregating  $251
million.

3 Financial Instruments:

Interest rate instruments
     The Company enters into interest rate swaps to minimize the risks and costs
associated  with its financial activities. The swap agreements are contracts  to
exchange   fixed  or  variable  rates  for  floating  interest   rate   payments
periodically over the life of the instruments. The notional amounts are used  to
measure  interest to be paid or received and do not represent  the  exposure  to
credit loss. The rates paid on these swaps range from 3-month Deutschmark  LIBOR
minus  .0676%  to  30-day  Commercial  Paper  Non-Financial  plus  .134%.  These
instruments  are not recorded on the balance sheet, and as of January  31,  1998
and 1997, are as follows:

</TABLE>

Foreign exchange instruments
    The Company has entered into a foreign currency swap to hedge its investment
in  Germany. Under the agreement, the Company will pay $1,960 million in  German
Deutschmarks  in 2003 and will receive $1,101 million in United States  Dollars.
At January 31, 1998, the fair value of this swap was $30 million.
    The Company enters routinely into forward currency exchange contracts in the
regular  course  of  business to manage its exposure  against  foreign  currency
fluctuations  on  inventory purchases denominated in foreign  currencies.  These
contracts are for short durations (six months or less) and are insignificant  to
the  Company's  operations or financial position. (There were approximately  $27
million outstanding at January 31, 1998.)

Fair value of financial instruments
     Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount approximates fair value  due
to the short maturity of these instruments.
     Long-term  debt: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt,  including
current maturities, approximates $8,639 million at January 31, 1998 and is based
on  the  Company's  current  incremental borrowing rate  for  similar  types  of
borrowing arrangements.
    Interest rate instruments: The fair values are estimated amounts the Company
would receive or pay to terminate the agreements as of the reporting dates.
    Foreign currency contracts: The fair value of foreign currency contracts are
estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers.

many  part-time associates become participants following one year of employment.
In fiscal 1998, the Company add
ed  401(k) plans in which the same associates may elect to contribute up to  10%
of their earnings.
     The Company will make annual contributions to these plans on behalf of  all
eligible associates, including those who have not elected to contribute  to  the
401(k) plan.
    Annual Company contributions are made at the sole discretion of the Company,
and  were  $321 million, $247 million and $204 million in 1998, 1997  and  1996,
respectively.

6 Acquisitions

     A  merger of the Mexican joint venture companies owned by Wal-Mart  Stores,
Inc.  and Cifra, S.A. de C.V. (Cifra) with, and into Cifra, was consummated with
an  effective  merger  date of September 1, 1997. The  Company  received  voting
shares  of Cifra equaling approximately 33.5% of the  outstanding voting  shares
of Cifra in exchange for the Company's joint venture interests having a net book
value  of  approximately $644 million. No gain or loss  was  recognized  on  the
exchange  of  the joint venture interest. The Company then acquired  593,100,000
shares of the Series "A" Common Shares and Series "B" Common Shares of Cifra, in
a  cash tender offer. The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase.  The
net  assets  and  liabilities acquired are recorded  at  fair  value.  Resulting
goodwill is being amortized over 40 years. As a result of the merger and  tender
offer,  Wal-Mart  holds approximately 51% of the outstanding  voting  shares  of
Cifra.  The  results of operations for Cifra, since the effective  merger  date,
have been included in the Company's results.
     In  December 1997, the Company acquired the Wertkauf hypermarket  chain  in
Germany,  as  well  as  certain real estate.  The 21 hypermarkets  are  one-stop
shopping  centers  that  offer  a  broad  assortment  of  high-quality   general
merchandise and food and are similar to the Wal-Mart Supercenter format  in  the
United  States. The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase. Net assets
and  liabilities of Wertkauf and the real estate are recorded at fair value. The
goodwill  is  being amortized over 40 years. The transaction closed on  December
30,   1997;  therefore,  the  assets  are  included  in  the  January  31,  1998
consolidated  balance  sheet  and the results of  operations  will  be  included
beginning in fiscal 1999.
     In  December  1997, the Company acquired the 40% minority interest  in  its
Brazilian  joint venture from Lojas Americanas, and then sold a 5% share  to  an
individual. The purchase price of the minority interest approximated book value.
Because  the transaction closed on December 30, 1997, the results of  operations
for fiscal 1998 include the Company's original ownership percentage of the joint
venture.
     Pro  forma results of operations are not presented due to the insignificant
differences from historical results, both individually and in the aggregate.
     The  fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded as a result of these
transactions is as follows (in millions):

7 Stock Option Plans

     At  January  31, 1998, 70 million shares of common stock were reserved  for
issuance  under stock option plans. The options granted under the  stock  option

17,  1995, may be exercised in nine annual installments. Options granted  on  or
after  November  17,  1995, may be exercised in seven annual  installments.  The
Company  has  elected  to follow Accounting Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25,
"Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) and related interpretations
in  accounting for its employee stock options because the alternative fair value

Compensation,"  requires  the  use of option  valuation  models  that  were  not
developed  for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because  the
exercise  price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market  price
of  the  underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation  expense  is
recognized.
      Pro  forma  information, regarding net income and  income  per  share,  is
required  by  Statement  123  and has been determined  as  if  the  Company  had
accounted  for its associate stock option plans under the fair value  method  of
that statement. The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of the
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumption
ranges:  risk-free interest rates between 7.2% and 5.6%, dividend yields between
0.7%  and 1.0%, volatility factors between .23 and .27, and an expected life  of
the  option of 7.4 years for the options issued prior to November 17,  1995  and
5.8 years for options issued thereafter.
    The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the  fair  value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions  and  are
fully transferrable. In addition, option valuation methods require the input  of
highly  subjective  assumptions including the expected stock  price  volatility.
Because the Company's associate stock options have characteristics significantly
different  from  those of traded options, and because changes in the  subjective
input   assumptions  can  materially  affect  the  fair  value   estimates,   in
management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a  reliable

          Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Annual Report - Page 35

single measure of the fair value of its associate stock options. Using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model, the weighted average grant date value of
options granted during the year ended January 31, 1998, was $13 per option.

     The  effect  of  applying the fair value method of  Statement  123  to  the
Company's  option  plan does not result in net income and net income  per  share
that  are  materially  different  from the amounts  reported  in  the  Company's
consolidated  financial statements as demonstrated below: (Amounts  in  millions

8 Long-term Lease Obligations

     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have long-term leases  for
stores  and  equipment.  Rentals (including, for  certain  leases,  amounts
applicable  to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses  and
contingent  rentals)  under all operating leases were  $596  million,  $561
million  and  $531 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Aggregate
minimum  annual  rentals at January 31, 1998, under  non-cancelable  leases
are as follows (in millions):

Present value of minimum lease payments                           $ 2,585

</TABLE>

     Certain of the leases provide for contingent additional rentals  based
on  percentage of sales. Such additional rentals amounted to  $46  million,
$51  million  and  $41  million  in  1998,  1997  and  1996,  respectively.
Substantially  all of the store leases have renewal options for  additional
terms from five to 25 years at comparable rentals.
     The  Company has entered into lease commitments for land and buildings
for   38  future  locations.  These  lease  commitments  with  real  estate
developers  provide  for  minimum rentals for 20  to  25  years,  excluding
renewal options, which if consummated based on current cost estimates, will
approximate $38 million annually over the lease terms.

9 Segments

     The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries are principally  engaged  in  the
operation of mass merchandising stores located in all 50 states, Argentina,
Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico and Puerto Rico, and through joint ventures
in China.
     In  June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)  issued
Statement No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information," which the Company has adopted in the current year.
       The   Company   identifies  such  segments   based   on   management
responsibility  within  the  United  States  and  geographically  for   all
international  units.  The Wal-Mart Stores segment includes  the  Company's
discount  stores  and  Supercenters in the United States.  The  SAM'S  Club
segment  includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States.  The
Company's  operations in Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico and  China  are
consolidated  using a December fiscal year end, generally due to  statutory
reporting requirements. There were no significant intervening events  which
materially affected the financial statements. The Company measures  segment
profit  as  operating  profit, which is defined as income  before  interest
expense, income taxes and minority interest. Information on segments and  a
reconciliation to income, before income taxes and minority interest, are as
follows (in millions):

Additions  to  international  long-lived assets  are  $2,401  million,  $317
million  and  $747  million  in  1998,  1997  and  1996,  respectively.  The
international  segment includes all international real estate.  All  of  the
real estate in the United States is included in the "Other" category and  is
leased  to  Wal-Mart  Stores and SAM'S Club. The  revenues  in  the  "other"
category  result  from  sales to third parties by McLane  Company,  Inc.,  a
wholesale distributor.
     McLane offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery products, which
it  sells to a variety of retailers including the Company's Wal-Mart  Stores
and  SAM'S Club. McLane is not a significant segment and, therefore, results
are not presented separately.

     We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are  free
of  material  misstatement. An audit includes examining, on  a  test  basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the  overall
financial  statement  presentation. We believe that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In  our  opinion,  the financial statements referred to  above  present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wal-
Mart  Stores,  Inc. and Subsidiaries at January 31, 1998 and 1997,  and  the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows  for  each  of
the  three  years  in the period ended January 31, 1998, in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.
