                 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION
                                     
      This  Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to  be
"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of the Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform  Act  of 1995. Statements included  or  incorporated  by
reference   in  this  Form  10-K  which  address  activities,   events   or
developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may  occur  in
the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including
the  amount and nature thereof), expansion and other development trends  of
industry  segments  in  which  the Company is  active,  business  strategy,
expansion  and  growth of the Company's business and operations  and  other
such  matters are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes
the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based  on
reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its  business,
a  number  of factors could cause actual results to differ materially  from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written,
made  by or on behalf of the Company. Many of these factors have previously
been  identified  in  filings or statements made by or  on  behalf  of  the
Company.

     All  phases  of  the  Company's operations are subject  to  influences
outside  its  control. Any one, or a combination, of  these  factors  could
materially  affect the results of the Company's operations.  These  factors
include: the cost of goods, competitive pressures, inflation, consumer debt
levels,  currency  exchange fluctuations, trade  restrictions,  changes  in
tariff  and freight rates, Year 2000 issues, unemployment levels,  interest
rate fluctuations and other capital market and economic conditions. Forward-
looking  statements  made by or on behalf of the Company  are  based  on  a
knowledge  of  its business and the environment in which it  operates,  but
because  of the factors listed above, actual results may differ from  those
in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, all of the forward-looking
statements made are qualified by these and other cautionary statements  and
there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  actual  results  or  developments
anticipated  by  the  Company will be realized or,  even  if  substantially
realized,  that they will have the expected consequences to or  effects  on
the Company or its business or operations.

                          FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT
                    FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 1999
                                     
                                  PART I
                                     
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

      Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  (together with its subsidiaries  hereinafter
referred  to as the "Company") is the world's largest retailer measured  by
total revenues.  During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999, the Company
had net sales of $137,634,000,000.

          (a)  Development of Business

           Domestically,  at January 31, 1999, the Company  operated  1,869
discount  stores  and  564  Supercenters,  and  451  SAM'S  Clubs.   Tables
summarizing  information concerning additions of units and  square  footage
for  domestic  discount stores, Supercenters and SAM'S Clubs since  January
31, 1994, are included as Schedules A and B to Item 1 found on pages 10 and
11 of this annual report.

           In fiscal 1999, the Company took possession of 74 units from the
Interspar hypermarket chain in Germany.  The units were acquired from  Spar
Handels  AG,  a  German  company  that owns  multiple  retail  formats  and
wholesale  operations  throughout  Germany.   The  transaction  closed   on
December  29,  1998, Interspar's fiscal year end.  Therefore, the  acquired
assets  are  included  in the Company's consolidated balance  sheet  as  of
January  31, 1999, and the results of operations will be included beginning
in fiscal 2000.

          In fiscal 1999, the Company extended its presence in Asia with an
investment  in  Korea.  The Company acquired a majority  interest  in  four
existing  units as well as six undeveloped sites.  The four acquired  units
were  previously operated by Korea Makro.  The results of operations  since
the  effective date of the acquisition have been included in the  Company's
results of operations.

           See  Note  6  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
incorporated  by reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page  17  of  this
annual report for additional information regarding our acquisitions.

           Internationally, at January 31, 1999, the Company operated units
in  Argentina(13), Brazil(14), Canada(154), Germany(95),  Mexico(416),  and
Puerto  Rico(15),  and,  under joint venture agreements,  in  China(5)  and
Korea(4).   A table summarizing information concerning additions  of  units
and  square footage for international units operated since fiscal 1994,  is
included as Schedule C to Item 1 found on page 12 of this annual report.

          (b)  Financial information about the Company's industry segments

           The  Company  is  principally engaged in the operation  of  mass
merchandising  stores,  which  serve our customers  primarily  through  the
operation of three segments.

            The   Company   identifies   segments   based   on   management
responsibility  within  the  United  States  and  geographically  for   all
international  units.  The Wal-Mart Stores segment includes  the  Company's
discount  stores  and  Supercenters in the United States.  The  SAM'S  Club
segment  includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States.  The
International segment includes all operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
China,  Germany, Korea, Mexico and Puerto Rico.  For the financial  results
of  the  Company's operating segments, see Note 9 of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of Part  II  found
on page 17 of this annual report.

          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

          The Company, a Delaware corporation, has its principal offices in
Bentonville,  Arkansas.  Although the Company was incorporated  in  October
1969,  the businesses conducted by its predecessors began in 1945 when  Sam
M.  Walton  opened  a  franchise Ben Franklin  variety  store  in  Newport,
Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in
Versailles,  Missouri.   Until  1962, the Company's  business  was  devoted
entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first  Wal-
Mart  Discount  City  (discount store) was opened.   In  fiscal  1984,  the
Company  opened its first three SAM'S Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, its  first
Wal-Mart   Supercenter  (combination  full-line  supermarket  and  discount
store).   In  fiscal  1992,  the  Company  began  its  first  international
initiative when the Company entered into a joint venture in which it had  a
50%  interest with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (Cifra).  The Company's international
presence  has continued to expand and at January 31, 1999, the Company  had
operations in seven countries and Puerto Rico.

WAL-MART STORES OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  Wal-Mart  Stores  segment,  which  includes  the  Company's
discount  stores  and  Supercenters in the  United  States,  had  sales  of
$95,395,000,000, $83,820,000,000 and $74,840,000,000 for the  three  fiscal
years ended January 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. During the most
recent  fiscal  year,  no  single discount store  or  Supercenter  location
accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. See  Note
9  of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference
in  Item 8 of Part II found on page 17 of this annual report for additional
information regarding our segments.

          General.  The Company operates Wal-Mart discount stores in all 50
states.   The  average  size of a discount store  is  approximately  94,300
square feet. Wal-Mart Supercenters are located in 29 states and the average
size  of  a  Supercenter is 181,200 square feet. The Supercenter prototypes
range in size from 110,000 square feet to 234,000 square feet.

</PAGE 4>

<PAGE 5>
            Merchandise.    Wal-Mart  discount  stores  and   the   general
merchandise  area  of  the  Supercenters are generally  organized  with  40
departments and offer a wide variety of merchandise, including apparel  for
women,  girls,  men, boys and infants.  Each store also carries  domestics,
fabrics  and  notions,  stationery and books, shoes, housewares,  hardware,
electronics,  home  furnishings, small appliances, automotive  accessories,
horticulture   and  accessories,  sporting  goods,  toys,  pet   food   and
accessories,  cameras and supplies, health and beauty aids, pharmaceuticals
and  jewelry.  In  addition,  the stores offer  an  assortment  of  grocery
merchandise,  with  the  assortment  in  Supercenters  being  broader   and
including meat, produce, deli, bakery, dairy, frozen foods and dry grocery.

           Nationally  advertised merchandise accounts for  a  majority  of
sales  in the stores. The Company markets lines of merchandise under  store
brands  including but not limited to "Sam's American Choice", "One Source",
"Great  Value", "Ol' Roy" and "Equate". The Company also markets  lines  of
merchandise  under  licensed brands; some of which include  "Faded  Glory",
"Kathie  Lee", "White Stag", "Puritan", "Better Homes & Gardens",  "Popular
Mechanics", "Catalina", "McKids", "Basic Equipment" and "House Beautiful".

           During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999, sales in discount
stores and Supercenters (which are subject to seasonal variance) by product
category were as follows:
                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

                                                  100%

           Operations.  Hours of operations vary by location, but generally
range from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. six days a week, and from 10:00 a.m.  to
8:00 p.m. on Sunday for discount stores and Supercenters.  In addition,  an
increasing number of discount stores and almost all of the Supercenters are
open 24 hours each day.  Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters maintain
uniform  prices,  except  where lower prices are necessary  to  meet  local
competition.   Sales are primarily on a self-service, cash-and-carry  basis
with  the objective of maximizing sales volume and inventory turnover while
minimizing expenses.  Bank credit card programs, operated without  recourse
to the Company, are available in all stores.

           Seasonal  Aspects of Operations.  The Wal-Mart Stores  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
</PAGE 5>

<PAGE 6>

volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

            Competition.   Wal-Mart  discount  stores  compete  with  other
discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are
national chains.  Wal-Mart Supercenters compete with other supercenter-type
stores,  discount stores, supermarkets and specialty stores, many of  which
are national or regional chains.  The Company also competes with others for
new  club  sites.  As of January 31, 1999, based on net sales, the Wal-Mart
Stores  segment ranked first among all retail department store  chains  and
among all discount department store chains.

          The Company's competitive position within the industry is largely
determined by its ability to offer value and service to its customers.  The
Company  has  many programs designed to meet the competitive needs  of  its
industry.  These include "Everyday Low Price", "Item Merchandising", "Store-
Within-a-Store"  and  "Price  Rollbacks" programs.   Although  the  Company
believes  it  has  had a major influence in most of the retail  markets  in
which  its  stores  are  located, there is  no  assurance  that  this  will
continue.

           Distribution.  During the 1999 fiscal year, approximately 84% of
the Wal-Mart discount stores' and Supercenters' purchases were shipped from
Wal-Mart's  43 distribution centers, nine of which are grocery distribution
centers,  and two of which are import distribution centers. The balance  of
merchandise  purchased was shipped directly to the stores  from  suppliers.
The  43 centers are located throughout the continental United States.  Five
distribution  centers are located in each of Arkansas and Texas;  three  in
South  Carolina;  two  in  each of California, Florida,  Georgia,  Indiana,
Mississippi,  New  York  and Pennsylvania; and  one  in  each  of  Alabama,
Arizona,  Colorado,  Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New  Hampshire,  New
Mexico,  North  Carolina,  Ohio,  Oregon,  Tennessee,  Utah,  Virginia  and
Wisconsin.

SAM'S CLUB OPERATING SEGMENT

           The  SAM'S Club segment, which includes the warehouse membership
clubs  in  the United States, had sales of $22,881,000,000, $20,668,000,000
and  $19,785,000,000  for the three fiscal years ended  January  31,  1999,
1998,  and  1997,  respectively.  During the most recent  fiscal  year,  no
single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales  or
net  income.  See  Note  9  of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements
incorporated  by reference in Item 8 of Part II found on page  17  of  this
annual report for additional information regarding our segments.

           General.  The  Company operates SAM'S Clubs in 48  states.   The
average size of a SAM'S Club is approximately 121,200 square feet, and club
sizes  generally range between 90,000 and 150,000 square feet  of  building
area.

           Merchandise.  SAM'S  Clubs offer bulk  displays  of  name  brand
hardgood merchandise, some softgoods and institutional size grocery  items,
and  selected items under the "Member's Mark" store brand.  Generally  each
</PAGE 6>

<PAGE 7>

SAM'S  Club  also carries software and electronic goods, jewelry,  sporting
goods,  toys,  tires,  stationery and books.  Most clubs  have  fresh  food
departments,  which  include bakery, meat and produce.  In  addition,  some
clubs offer one-hour photo, embroidery departments, pharmaceuticals and gas
stations.

          During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999, sales in the clubs
(which  are  subject  to  seasonal variance) by product  category  were  as
follows:

                                              PERCENTAGE
          CATEGORY                             OF SALES

          Sundries..........................       31.6
          Food .............................       32.8
          Hardlines ........................       22.1
          Softlines ........................        5.7
          Service Businesses................        7.8
                                                  100.0%

          Operations.  Operating hours vary among SAM'S Clubs, but they are
generally  open  Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30  p.m.   Most
SAM'S  Clubs  are open Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and  on  Sunday
from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

           SAM'S  Clubs  are  membership only,  cash-and-carry  operations.
However,  a  financial  service  credit card  program  (Discover  Card)  is
available  in  all clubs and the "SAM'S Direct" commercial finance  program
and  "Business  Revolving  Credit"  are available  to  qualifying  business
members.  Also, a "Personal Credit" program is available to qualifying club
members.  Any credit issued under these programs is without recourse to the
Company.   Club  members include businesses and those individuals  who  are
members  of certain qualifying organizations, such as government and  state
employees and credit union members.  In fiscal 1999, business members  paid
an  annual  membership fee of $30 for the primary membership  card  with  a
spouse card available at no additional cost.  The annual membership fee for
an  individual member is $35 for the primary membership card with a  spouse
card available at no additional cost.

            Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The  SAM'S  Club  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest  volume
occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

           Competition.  SAM'S Clubs compete with warehouse clubs, as  well
as  with  discount  retailers, wholesale grocers  and  general  merchandise
wholesalers and distributors. The Company also competes with others for new
club sites.  As of January 31, 1999, based on domestic U.S. net sales,  the
SAM'S Club segment ranked first among all warehouse clubs.

          Distribution.  During fiscal 1999, approximately 61% of the SAM'S
Club  purchases were shipped from distribution facilities. The balance  was
shipped directly to the clubs from suppliers.  Operationally, the principle
</PAGE 7>

<PAGE 8>

focus  is  on  crossdocking product, while maintaining stored inventory  is
minimized.   A  combination of Company owned and  operated  facilities  and
third-party facilities comprise the overall distribution structure.


INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT

           The Company's International Segment is comprised of wholly owned
operations  in  Argentina, Canada, Germany and Puerto Rico;  through  joint
ventures  in  China and Korea; and through majority-owned  subsidiaries  in
Brazil and Mexico. Sales for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 1999,
1998,  and  1997  were $12,247,000,000, $7,517,000,000 and  $5,002,000,000,
respectively.   During  the  most recent fiscal year,  no  single  location
accounted for as much as 1% of total Company sales or net income. See  Note
9  of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference
in  Item 8 of Part II found on page 17 of this annual report for additional
information regarding our segments.

          General.  Operating formats vary by country, but include Wal-Mart
discount  stores  in  Canada  and Puerto Rico; Supercenters  in  Argentina,
Brazil,  China, Korea and Mexico; SAM'S Clubs in Argentina, Brazil,  China,
Mexico, and Puerto Rico; Hypermarkets in Germany and Superamas (traditional
supermarket,)  Bodegas  (discount  store,)  Aurreras  (combination  store,)
Suburbias (specialty department store) and Vips (restaurant) in Mexico.

           Merchandise.    The merchandising strategy in the  International
operating  segment is similar to that of domestic segments in  the  breadth
and  scope  of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name  merchandise
accounts  for  a majority of sales, several store brands not found  in  the
United  States  have  been developed to serve customers  in  the  different
markets  in  which the International segment operates.  In addition,  steps
have been taken to develop relationships with local vendors in each country
to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

           Operations.  The hours of operation for operating units  in  the
international  division  vary by country and by individual  markets  within
countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours  of
operation.   While  sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry  basis,  credit
cards  or  other  consumer finance programs exist  in  certain  markets  to
facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

           Seasonal  Aspects  of  Operations.  The International  operating
segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, the highest
volume  of  sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter.  The seasonality  of
the  business  varies  by country due to different national  and  religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

          Competition.  The International operating segment competes with a
variety  of  local,  national and international  chains  in  the  discount,
department,  drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of  the  retail
market.   The  segment's  competitive position is determined,  to  a  large
extent,  by  its  ability  to offer its customers  low  prices  on  quality
merchandise that offers exceptional value.  In Supercenters, our ability to

<PAGE 9>

effectively  operate  the  food departments  has  a  major  impact  on  the
segment's  competitive position in the markets where we operate.

            Distribution.    The  International  segment  operates   export
consolidation facilities in Jacksonville, Florida; Seattle, Washington; and
Laredo,  Texas in support of product flow to its Mexican, Asian, and  Latin
American  markets.   In addition, distribution facilities  are  located  in
Argentina,  Brazil, Canada, China and Mexico which process  and  flow  both
imported  and domestic product to the operating units.  Operationally,  the
principle  focus  is  on  crossdocking product,  while  maintaining  stored
inventory  is  minimized.   During fiscal 1999, approximately  50%  of  the
International  merchandise  purchases  flowed  through  these  distribution
facilities.  The balance was shipped directly to the stores from suppliers.
A  combination  of  Company owned and operated facilities  and  third-party
facilities  comprises the overall distribution structure for  International
logistics.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

           The  number  and  location  of domestic  and  international  Wal-Mart
discount  stores,  Supercenters and SAM'S Clubs  is  incorporated  by  reference
to  the  table  under  the caption "Fiscal 1999 End of  Year  Store  Counts"  on
Page  17  of  the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended  January  31,
1999.

            The  Company  owns  1,488  properties  on  which  domestic  discount
stores  and  Supercenters  are  located and  214  of  the  properties  on  which
domestic  SAM'S  are  located.   In  some  cases,  the  Company  owns  the  land
associated  with  leased  buildings.   New buildings,  both  leased  and  owned,
are constructed by independent contractors.

           The  remaining  buildings  in which its  present  domestic  locations
are  located  are  either  leased from a commercial property  developer,  leased
pursuant   to   a   sale/leaseback  arrangement   or   leased   from   a   local
governmental  entity  through an industrial revenue bond  transaction.   All  of
the  Company's  leases  for  its stores provide for fixed  annual  rentals  and,
in   many  cases,  the  leases  provide  for  additional  rent  based  on  sales
volume.

            Domestically,   the   Company  operated  43  Wal-Mart   distribution
facilities  and  19  McLane  distribution  facilities  at  January   31,   1999.
These   distribution  facilities  are  primarily  owned  by  the  Company,   and
several  are  subject  to  mortgage secured loans.   Some  of  the  distribution
facilities   are   leased   under   industrial   development   bond    financing
arrangements  and  provide  the option of purchasing  these  facilities  at  the
end of the lease term for nominal amounts.

           The  Company  owns  office facilities in Bentonville,  Arkansas  that
serve  as  the  home  office  for the Company and owns  an  office  facility  in
Temple, Texas which serves as the home office for McLane.

            Internationally,  the  Company  has  a  combination  of  owned   and
leased  properties  in each country in which the operating  units  are  located.
The  Company  owns  ten  properties in Argentina, eight  properties  in  Brazil,
seven  properties  in  Canada, one property in China  under  joint  venture,  21
properties  in  Germany,  four  properties in Korea  under  joint  venture,  242
properties  in  Mexico,  and  four  properties  in  Puerto  Rico  in  which  the
operating  units  are located, with the remaining units in  each  country  being
leased.

           The  Company  utilizes  both owned and leased properties  for  office
facilities in each country in which we conduct business.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

            The   Company  is  not  a  party  to  any  material  pending   legal
proceedings  and  no  properties of the Company  are  subject  to  any  material
pending  legal  proceeding,  other than routine  litigation  incidental  to  its
business.

            The   Company   recently   opened  a   Supercenter   in   Honesdale,
Pennsylvania.   In  February of 1999, the Company settled  claims  made  by  the
Pennsylvania  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  that  the  construction
activities  led  to  excess erosion and sedimentation of  a  nearby  creek.   In
the  settlement,  Wal-Mart  agreed to pay a fine of $25,000  and  to  perform  a
$75,000  community  environmental project in the Honesdale  area.   The  Company
is  negotiating  settlement  of  a claim by the  United  States  Army  Corps  of
Engineers  that  the  construction  resulted in  the  filling  of  approximately
0.76  acres  in  excess  of the permitted fill area of waters  and  wetlands  at
the  site.   The  proposed settlement with the Corps will  require  Wal-Mart  to
pay  $200,000  to  a non-profit corporation for the purchase of  local  wetlands
conservation  areas  and  easements.  Under   contracts   with  third   parties,
Wal-Mart  has received  reimbursement  for the $75,000  community  environmental
project and the $25,000  fine.  Wal-Mart  also  expects to be  reimbursed  under
third  party contracts for the $200,000 proposed settlement amount.

                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 4

under  the  Exchange Act ("Rule 16b-3").  With respect to  Performance
Based  Awards,  the Plan shall be administered by a committee  of  the
Board comprised solely of two or more outside directors, as defined in
Code Section 162(m)(4)(C).

4.2  The Committee shall have these duties as to the Plan:

     (a)  to establish rules, procedures, and forms governing the Plan;

     (b)  to interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan and any Plan
          Award;

     (c)  to recommend amendments of the Plan to the Board;

     (d)  to determine those Associates who will be Recipients and what

     (f)  to determine the Fair Market Value of the Shares; and
     
     (g)  to amend the terms of any Plan Award or to waive any conditions
          or obligations of a Recipient under or with respect to any

Wal-Mart.

4.4   If  the  Committee  intends that a Plan Award  qualify  for  the
performance-based   compensation   exception   under   Code    Section
162(m)(4)(C),  the Committee will exercise its discretion  to  qualify
the   Plan   Award   for  that  exception.   All  actions   taken   or
determinations made by the Committee, in good faith, with  respect  to
the  Plan,  a Plan Award or any Notification shall not be  subject  to
review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive upon  all
person interested in the Plan or any Plan Award.

                             PARTICIPATION

5.1   All  Associates whom the Committee determines have the potential
to  contribute significantly to the success of the Company, as well as
Non-Associate  Directors, may participate in the Plan,  although  Non-
Associate  Directors  may  not receive Incentive  Stock  Options.   An
Associate  or Non-Associate Director may be granted one or  more  Plan
Awards,  unless  prohibited  by applicable  law  and  subject  to  the
limitations  under  Code Section 422 with respect to  Incentive  Stock
Options.

                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 5

                             STOCK OPTIONS

6.1  Term of Options.  Wal-Mart may grant Options covering the Subject
Shares  to  Associates or Non-Associate Directors.  The term  of  each
Option  shall be the term stated in the Option Notification; provided,
however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall
be  no  more than 10 years from the date of grant unless the Incentive
Stock  Option is granted to an Optionee who, at the time of the grant,
owns  stock  representing more than 10% of the  voting  power  of  all
classes of stock of Wal-Mart or any Parent/Subsidiary Corporation,  in
which case the term may not exceed 5 years from the date of grant.

Each Option shall be a Nonqualified Option unless designated otherwise
in  the  Option Notification.  Notwithstanding the designation  of  an
Option,  if  the  aggregate Fair Market Value  of  Shares  subject  to
Incentive  Stock  Options are exercisable for the  first  time  by  an
Optionee  during  a  calendar year exceeds $100,000  (whether  due  to
acceleration of exercisability, miscalculation or error),  the  excess
Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Options.

6.2   Option Exercise Price and Consideration.  The per Share exercise
price  of  an  Option  shall be determined by  the  Committee  in  its
discretion, except that the per Share exercise price for an  Incentive
Stock Option shall be 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on  the
date  of grant unless the Associate to whom the Incentive Stock Option
is  granted owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting  power
of   all  classes  of  stock  of  Wal-Mart  or  any  Parent/Subsidiary
Corporation  at  the  time of the grant in which case  the  per  Share
exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per
Share on the date of grant.

The type of consideration in which the exercise price of an Option  is
to  be  paid  shall be determined by the Committee in its  discretion,
and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined  at
the time of grant.
     
6.3  Exercise of Options.  An Option  shall be  deemed to be exercised
when  the  person  entitled  to  exercise the Option  gives  notice of
exercise to Wal-Mart in  accordance with  the Option's  terms and Wal-
Mart receives  full payment for  the Shares as to  which the Option is
exercised.

6.4  Termination of Employment.  If an Optionee's Continuous Status as
an  Associate  is terminated, the Optionee may, subject to  Wal-Mart's
right to terminate the Associate for Cause, exercise Options vested as
of  the  termination date to the extent set out in  Optionee's  Option
Notification. Incentive Stock Options may be exercised only within  60
days  (or other period of time determined by the Committee at the time
of  grant of the Option and not exceeding 3 months) after the date  of
the termination (but in no event later than the expiration date of the
term of that Option as set forth in the Option Notification), and only
to  the  extent  that Optionee was entitled to exercise the  Incentive
Stock  Option  at  the date of that termination.  To  the  extent  the
Optionee is not entitled to or does not exercise an Option at the date
of  that  termination or within the time specified herein  or  in  the
Option Notification, the Option shall terminate.  During a period  for
which  the  Optionee  is  subject  to administrative  suspension  from
employment,  the  Optionee's  right  to  exercise  Options   will   be
suspended.

6.5   Disability of Optionee.  Notwithstanding the provisions  of  the
immediately  preceding  paragraph,  in  the  case  of  an   Optionee's
Incentive  Stock  Option, if the Optionee's Continuous  Status  as  an


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 6

Associate  is terminated as a result of his or her total and permanent
disability  (as defined in Code Section 22(e)(3)), Optionee  may,  but
only  within 12 months from the date of that termination  (but  in  no
event later than the expiration date of the term of that Option as set
forth  in the Option Notification), exercise an Incentive Stock Option
to  the  extent otherwise entitled to exercise it at the date of  that
termination.  To the extent the Optionee is not entitled  to  exercise
an  Incentive Stock Option at the date of termination, or if  Optionee
does  not  exercise  that  Incentive Stock Option  to  the  extent  so
entitled within the time specified herein, the Incentive Stock  Option
shall terminate.


6.6   Reload  Options.   If  an  Optionee  exercises  an  Option  (the
"Original  Option")  while the Optionee is  an  Associate  or  a  Non-
Associate Director by paying all or a portion of the exercise price of
the  Shares  subject to the Original Option by tendering  to  Wal-Mart
Shares  owned  by  that person, an Option to purchase  the  number  of
Shares  used  for  this purpose by the Associate or the  Non-Associate
Director,  as  the  case  may be (the "Reload  Option")  may,  at  the
Committee's discretion, be granted to the Associate, as a part of  the
Original  Option, as evidenced in the Optionee's Option  Notification.
The  Reload Option may be exercised at any time during the term of the
Original  Option, under the terms and conditions, and subject  to  any
limitations   as  may  be  placed  on  that  exercisability   in   the
Notification.

6.7   Non-transferability  of Options.  An Option  may  not  be  sold,
pledged,  assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed  of  in  any
manner  except  by testamentary devise or by the laws  of  descent  or
distribution  or  in those circumstances expressly  permitted  by  the
Committee.

                           RESTRICTED STOCK

7.1   Grant  of Restricted Stock Awards.  Wal-Mart may make Restricted
Stock  Awards  to those Associates or Non-Associate Directors  as  the
Committee  may  determine  in its sole discretion.   Restricted  Stock
Awards  may  be made with respect to up to an aggregate of  16,000,000
Subject  Shares.  Each Restricted Stock Award shall have  those  terms
and  conditions that are expressly set forth in, or are  required  by,
the  Plan  and any other terms and conditions as the Committee  making
the Restricted Stock Award may determine in its discretion.

7.2   Dividend Receipt; Voting.  While any Restriction applies to  any
Recipient's  Restricted  Stock, (i) the Recipient  shall  receive  the
dividends  paid on the Restricted Stock and shall not be  required  to
return  those dividends to Wal-Mart in the event of the forfeiture  of
the Restricted Stock, (ii) the Recipient shall receive the proceeds of
the  Restricted  Stock  in  any  stock  split,  reverse  stock  split,
recapitalization,  or other change in the capital  structure  of  Wal-
Mart,  which  proceeds shall automatically and without  need  for  any
other   action  become  Restricted  Stock  and  be  subject   to   all
Restrictions then existing as to the Recipient's Restricted Stock  and
(iii)  the  Recipient shall be entitled to vote the  Restricted  Stock
during the Restriction period.

7.3   Issuance  of  Restricted Stock.  The Restricted  Stock  will  be
issued  to each Recipient subject to the understanding that while  any
Restriction applies to the Restricted Stock, the Recipient  shall  not


                 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 7

have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate,
grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of
or  encumber  any shares of Restricted Stock or any interest  therein.
As a result of the retention of rights in the Restricted Stock by Wal-
Mart,  except  as  required  by any law, neither  any  shares  of  the
Restricted  Stock  nor any interest therein shall be  subject  in  any
manner  to  any  forced  or  involuntary sale,  transfer,  conveyance,
pledge,  hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition  or  to  any
charge,  liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient,  whether  as
the  direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient  or  any
action  taken  in any proceeding, including any proceeding  under  any
bankruptcy  or other creditors' rights law.  Any action attempting  to
effect any transaction of that type shall be void.

7.4   Forfeiture.   Unless expressly provided for  in  the  Restricted
Stock  Award  made to a Recipient, any Restricted Stock  held  by  the
Recipient at the time the Recipient ceases to be an Associate for  any
reason whatsoever shall be forfeited by the Recipient to Wal-Mart  and
automatically re-conveyed to Wal-Mart.

7.5   Withholding.  The Committee may withhold any amounts  or  Shares
necessary  to  collect  any  withholding taxes  with  respect  to  any
Restricted  Stock Award or upon the fulfillment of the Restriction  in
that Restricted Stock Award.

7.6   Compliance with Law.  The making of Restricted Stock Awards  and
issuance  of any Restricted Stock is subject to compliance by Wal-Mart
with  all  applicable  laws.   Wal-Mart need  not  issue  or  transfer
Restricted Stock pursuant to the Plan unless Wal-Mart's legal  counsel
has  approved  all legal matters in connection with the  issuance  and
delivery of the Restricted Stock.

7.7   Evidence of Share Ownership. The Restricted Stock will be  book-
entry  shares  only unless the Committee decides to issue certificates
to  evidence shares of the Restricted Stock.  Any stock certificate(s)
representing  the Restricted Stock issued to a Recipient  that  is  so
issued shall bear the following legend:

  THE  SHARES  REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE  BEEN  ISSUED
  PURSUANT TO THE WAL-MART STORES, INC. STOCK INCENTIVE  PLAN  OF
  1998  (THE  "PLAN") AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RESTRICTIONS
  ON  THEIR  TRANSFER AND TO FORFEITURE TO WAL-MART STORES,  INC.
  IF  CERTAIN  CONDITIONS  ARE NOT MET.  THOSE  RESTRICTIONS  AND
  CONDITIONS  ARE  SET FORTH IN THE PLAN AND  IN  THE  RESTRICTED
  STOCK  AWARD PURSUANT TO WHICH THOSE SHARES WERE ISSUED TO  THE
  REGISTERED HOLDER THERE-OF.

Wal-Mart  will  place stop-transfer instructions with respect  to  all
Restricted Stock on its stock transfer records.

7.8    Deferral  of  Restricted  Stock.   In  the  discretion  of  the
Committee,  any  Recipient  of Restricted Stock  who  is  eligible  to
participate  in  the Wal-Mart Officer Deferred Compensation  Plan  may
defer  his or her Restricted Stock by electing to: (1) assign some  or


               Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 8

all of the Restricted Stock to Wal-Mart and to have an amount equal to
the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Stock assigned on the date  of
the  assignment credited to the benefit of the Recipient and  deferred
pursuant  to and in accordance with the terms of the Wal-mart  Officer
Deferred  Compensation Plan, provided that any amounts deferred  under
this  provision  and that plan shall not be considered in  determining
any  incentive payments to be made to the Recipient under Section  4.2
of  the  Wal-Mart Officer Deferred Compensation Plan; or (2)  transfer
some  or  all  of the Restricted Stock to Wal-Mart in  trust  for  the
benefit of the Recipient under terms that will permit the deferral  of
recognition of gain or income by the Recipient for federal income  tax
purposes  in connection with the receipt of the Restricted  Stock.   A
Recipient must make the election by no later than April 1 of the  year
prior  to the year in which the conditions in each of the Restrictions
relating   to  the  release  of  that  Restricted  Stock  from   those
Restrictions  would  be  met.   Each election  must  be  made  by  the
Recipient filing an election form with Wal-Mart.  Once an election  is
made, the Recipient may not revoke or change that election.

If  the Shares are the subject of a stock dividend, stock split, or  a
reverse stock split, the products of such action with respect  to  the
Restricted  Stock  held for a Recipient in escrow  shall  be  held  in
escrow  on  the  same  terms as the Restricted Stock.   Wal-Mart  will
credit to the Recipient's account on the date any dividend is paid  on
Shares the amount of the dividend paid on the Restricted Stock held in
escrow on that date.  The dividends credited to the account shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest paid on the
amounts  of compensation deferred under the Wal-Mart Officer  Deferred
Compensation Plan.

Shares  of Restricted Stock held by Wal-Mart pursuant to the terms  of
this  deferral provision, along with the cash amount credited  to  the
account  of the Recipient in respect of dividends, shall be  paid  out
to:   (1)  the  Recipient only upon the termination of the Recipient's
Continuous  Status as an Associate or, in the case of a  Non-Associate
Director, the Recipient ceasing to be a director of Wal-Mart  or  upon
any  demonstration that the Recipient is the subject of  any  hardship
pursuant to rules the Committee may establish employment; or  (2)  the
Recipients' named beneficiaries upon the death of the Recipient.


8.1    Stock  Value  Equivalent  Awards.   Wal-Mart  may  grant  Stock
Appreciation Rights on any terms and conditions as the Committee deems
desirable.  Any Recipient granted a Stock Appreciation Right  will  be
entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to  (i) the excess of  the
Fair  Market  Value of a Share on the date of exercise  of  the  Stock
Appreciation Right over the Fair Market Value of a Share on  the  date
of  grant  of  the  Stock Appreciation Right or (ii)  a  predetermined
amount  that is less than that excess or (iii) any other price as  may
be  set  by  the  Committee, multiplied by the number of  Shares  with
respect  to  which  the  Stock  Appreciation  Right  shall  have  been
exercised.   The  Committee  shall give the  Recipient  of  the  Stock
Appreciation Right Notification of the grant of the Stock Appreciation
Right.   The notice will state the terms and conditions of that  Stock
Appreciation Right.


               Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 9

8.2   Award  Vesting.   The Committee shall establish  the  conditions
pursuant  to and the period over which the rights of the Recipient  in
the Stock Appreciation Right will fully or partially vest with respect
to the Recipient.

8.3  Election To Receive Payments.  A Recipient may elect to receive a
payment  to  which the Recipient is entitled under the Plan  Award  by
giving notice of such election to the Committee in accordance with the
rules established by the Committee.

Exercise. If the Stock Appreciation Right has vested in whole or part,
a  Recipient  may exercise a Stock Appreciation Right  to  the  extent
vested by giving the Committee notice of the exercise on the form  and
in  compliance with the procedures established by the Committee.   The
date of exercise shall be the date Wal-Mart receives the notice of the
exercise.

8.4   Payment  to Recipients.  Subject to the terms and conditions  of
the  Plan Award granting the Stock Appreciation Right, payment upon  a
Recipient's exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right may be made (i)  in
cash or by check, (ii) in Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value
on  the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right equal to  the
payment  to  be made under the Stock Appreciation Right or  (iii)  any
combination  of cash and Shares, as the Committee shall  determine  in
its  discretion.   The Committee may elect to make this  determination
either  at the time the Stock Appreciation Right is granted,  or  with
respect to payments contemplated in clauses (i) and (ii) above, at the
time of the exercise.

                             MISCELLANEOUS

9.1   Issuance of Stock Certificates; Book-Entry.  If a Recipient  has
the  right  to the issuance of any Shares pursuant to any Plan  Award,
Wal-Mart  shall issue or cause to be issued a stock certificate  or  a
book-entry  crediting shares to the Recipient's account promptly  upon
the  exercise  of the Plan Award or the right arising under  the  Plan
Award.

9.2    Section  162(m)  Matters.   The  Compensation  and   Nominating
Committee  of  the Board may grant Plan Awards that  provide  for  the
rights  thereunder to accrue based on performance-based  criteria  and
that  is intended to qualify for the performance-based exception under
Code  Section 162(m)(4)(C).  In granting any Performance Based  Award,
the  Compensation  Committee shall comply fully with  the  regulations
promulgated  with  respect to Code Section 162(m). provided,  however,
that  no  Recipient  who is a "covered employee" as  defined  in  Code
Section 162(m)(3) shall receive grants of Plan Awards with respect  to
more  than  1,600,000 Shares and Share equivalents in any  one  fiscal
year  of  Wal-Mart, subject to adjustment as provided in the paragraph
captioned  "Adjustments  upon Changes in  Capitalization  or  Mergers"
below.  Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the issuance
of  Plan  Award  to any "covered employees" that are  not  Performance
Based Awards if the Committee so elects.

9.3   Termination  of Employment.  Except as otherwise  expressly  set
forth  in  the Plan, the Committee shall determine the effect  of  the
termination  of a Recipient's employment, a Recipient's disability  or
death  or a Non-Associate Director's ceasing to be a director of  Wal-


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 10

Mart  during any applicable vesting period contained in a  Plan  Award
made  to  the  Recipient.  During a period for which the Recipient  is
subject  to administrative suspension, a Recipient's right to exercise
any rights under any Plan Award or the vesting of any rights under any
Plan Award shall be suspended.

9.4   Termination for Cause.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained  in  the Plan, any Recipient whose Continuous Status  as  an
Associate is terminated by Wal-Mart for Cause shall forfeit  all  Plan
Awards  and  Restricted Stock granted under the Plan, whether  or  not
vested or otherwise exercisable.

9.5   Death of Recipient.  If a Recipient dies, the Recipient's  Award
may  be exercised, in accordance with its terms or as allowed by  law,
by  the  Recipient's estate or by a person who acquired the  right  to
exercise  the Award by bequest or inheritance, but only to the  extent
the Recipient was otherwise entitled to exercise the Award at the date
of  the Recipient's death and only if exercised within 12 months after
the  Recipient's  death.  To the extent the Award as unvested  at  the
date of death, the Award shall terminate.


9.6  Limitations on Liability and Award Obligations.  Receiving a Plan
Award  or  being  the owner of any Option, Restricted Stock  Award  or
Stock Appreciation Right shall not:

     (a)  give a Recipient any rights except as expressly set forth in
     the Plan or in the Plan Award and except as a stockholder of Wal-
     Mart as set forth herein as to the Restricted Stock only;

     (b)   as  to Shares issuable on the exercise of Options or  Stock
     Appreciation  Rights payable in Shares, until  the  issuance  (as
     evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of Wal-Mart of  a
     duly  authorized transfer agent of Wal-Mart) of the Shares issued
     upon exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, give  the
     Recipient the right to vote, or receive dividends on, the  Shares
     to  be  issued upon exercise or any other rights as a stockholder
     with   respect   to   the  Optioned  Stock   or   those   Shares,
     notwithstanding the exercise of the Option or Stock  Appreciation
     Right;
     
     (c)  be considered a contract of employment or give the Recipient
     any  right to continued employment, or to hold any position, with
     Wal-Mart or any Affiliate;
     
     (d)   create any fiduciary or other obligation of Wal-Mart or any
     Affiliate  to  take  any action or provide to the  Recipient  any
     assistance  or dedicate or permit the use of any assets  of  Wal-
     Mart  or any Affiliate that would permit the Recipient to be able
     to attain any performance criteria stated in the Recipient's Plan
     Award;
     
     (e)   create any trust, fiduciary or other duty or obligation  of
     Wal-Mart  or any Affiliate to engage in any particular  business,
     continue  to  engage in any particular business,  engage  in  any
     particular  business practices or sell any particular product  or
     products; or
     

               Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(l) - Page 11

     (f)   create  any  obligation of Wal-Mart or any  Affiliate  that
     shall  be  greater  than  the obligations  of  Wal-Mart  or  that
     Affiliate  to any general unsecured creditor of Wal-Mart  or  the
     Affiliate.
     
If  Wal-Mart or an Affiliate terminates a Recipient's employment  with
Wal-Mart  or the Affiliate, the potential value of any Plan  Award  or
Restricted  Stock that must be returned to Wal-Mart  will  not  be  an
element of any damages that the Recipient may have for any termination
of employment or other relationship in violation of any contractual or
other rights the Recipient may have.

9.7   No Liability of Committee Members.  Wal-Mart shall indemnify and
hold  harmless  each member of the Committee and each  other  officer,
director and Associate of Wal-Mart or any Affiliate that has any  duty
or  power  relating  to  the administration of the  Plan  against  any
liability, obligation, cost or expense incurred by that person arising
out  of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan or  any
Plan Award if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of Wal-Mart.

9.8  Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.  Subject to
any required action by the Wal-Mart stockholders, the number of Shares
covered  by each Plan Award, and the number of Shares which have  been
authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Plan  Awards
have  yet  been granted or which have been returned to the  Plan  upon
cancellation or expiration of a Plan Award, as well as the  price  per
Share covered by any outstanding Plan Award that includes in its terms
a  price per Share, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase
or decrease in the number of issued shares of the Common Stock of Wal-
Mart  resulting  from  a  stock  split,  reverse  stock  split,  stock
dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock of  Wal-
Mart, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares
effected   without  receipt  of  consideration  by   Wal-Mart.    That
adjustment  shall be made by the Committee, whose determination  shall
be  final,  binding  and  conclusive.  Except  as  expressly  provided
herein,  no issuance by Wal-Mart of shares of stock of any  class,  or
securities  convertible  into shares of  stock  of  any  class,  shall
affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect
to, the number or price of Shares subject to a Plan Award.

9.9    Notification.   Options,  Restricted  Stock  Awards  and  Stock
Appreciation Rights shall be evidenced by Notifications or other award
documents in the form approved by the Committee.

9.10   Amendment and Termination of the Plan.  The Board may amend  or
terminate  the Plan at any time without the approval of the Recipients
or  any other person, except to the extent any action of that type  is
required  to be approved by the stockholders of Wal-Mart in connection
with any outstanding Performance Based Awards.

9.11   Governing Law.  The Plan shall be governed by and construed  in
accordance  with  the laws of the State of Arkansas, except  that  any
matters  relating  to  the internal governance of  Wal-Mart  shall  be

                      WAL-MART STORES, INC.
                MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN OF 1998


GENERAL

      1.1.  Purpose.   The purpose of the Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.
Management  Incentive  Plan of 1998 ("MIP")  is  to  advance  the
interests  of  the  shareholders  of  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  by
providing  performance-based incentives  to  eligible  management
associates.

      1.2.  Effective Date.  The MIP shall be effective  for  the
Fiscal  Year beginning February 1, 1998, subject to the  approval
of  the  Company's shareholders, and shall remain  effective  for
each subsequent Fiscal Year until terminated by the Board.

      1.3.  Nature of MIP.  With respect to individuals  who  are
Covered  Employees,  the MIP is intended  to  provide  "qualified
performance-based  compensation," as  such  term  is  defined  in
Treas. Reg. 1.162-27(e), to the extent deemed appropriate by  the
Committee  at  the time Performance Goals are established  for  a
Fiscal Year.  Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the
MIP  to  provide both "qualified performance-based  compensation"
and  nonqualified compensation for the same Fiscal  Year  in  the
manner  permitted under Code Section 162(m).  The  MIP  shall  be
administered  and  construed  in a manner  consistent  with  Code
Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder for any Fiscal Year  in
which the MIP is intended to provide "qualified performance-based
compensation."

      1.4.  MIP Not Funded.  Incentive Plan Awards shall be  made
solely  from  the general assets of Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc.  or  a
Related  Affiliate, to the extent such payments or  benefits  are
attributable  to services with a Related Affiliate  participating
in the MIP.  To the extent any person acquires a right to receive
payments from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or a Related Affiliate  under
the  MIP,  the  right is no greater than the right of  any  other
unsecured general creditor.


DEFINITIONS

      2.1.  "Board"  means  the Board of  Directors  of  Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc.

      2.2.  "Committee"  means  the Compensation  and  Nominating
Committee of the Board, or such other committee designated by the
Board  as  the "Committee" under the MIP.  The Board may  appoint
different Committees with respect to Covered Employees  and  non-
Covered  Employees.  With respect to Covered Employees, any  such
Committee  must consist of two or more persons each of  whom  are
"outside directors" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m).

      2.3. "Company" means Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and each Related
Affiliate designated by the Committee as a participating employer
in the MIP.

      2.4.  "Covered Employee" has the meaning of such term under
Code Section 162(m)(3).


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(m) - Page 2

      2.5. "Incentive Percentage" means the pre-established award
formula  established by the Committee for each Fiscal Year  which
specifies  a  percentage of a Participant's  rate  of  salary  in
effect for the last full payroll period of the Fiscal Year to  be
paid  as  an  Incentive Plan Award.  The Committee may  establish
different  Incentive Percentages for individual  Participants  or
different classes of Participants, and/or the achievement  levels
of  the  Performance  Goals.   Solely  with  respect  to  Covered
Employees,  for any Fiscal Year for which the MIP is intended  to
provide "qualified performance-based compensation," the Incentive
Percentages   applicable  to  the  Covered  Employees   must   be
established  by  the Committee no later than 90  days  after  the
beginning  of the Fiscal Year for which the Incentive Plan  Award
pertains.

      2.6.  "Incentive  Plan Award" means  the  annual  incentive
compensation award granted under the MIP which is contingent  and
based  upon the attainment of the Performance Goals with  respect
to a Fiscal Year.

      2.7.  "Participant"  means  an  associate  of  the  Company
participating  in  the  Plan as provided in  the  "Participation"
section of the MIP.

     2.8. "Performance Goals" means the pre-established objective
performance  goals established by the Committee for  each  Fiscal
Year.   Solely with respect to Covered Employees, for any  Fiscal
Year  for  which  the  MIP  is  intended  to  provide  "qualified
performance-based compensation," Performance Goals applicable  to
the  Covered  Employees must be established by the  Committee  no
later  than  90  days after the beginning of the Fiscal  Year  to
which  the Performance Goals pertain.  The Performance Goals  may
be  based  upon  the performance of the Company  or  any  Related
Company,  or division thereof, using one or more of the following
operating  performance measures selected by the  Committee:   (a)
earnings;  (b)  revenue; (c) operating or  net  cash  flows;  (d)
financial return ratios; (e) total shareholder return; (f) market
share; or (g) pre-tax profits.  Separate Performance Goals may be
established  by  the  Committee for  the  Company  or  a  Related
Affiliate,  or  division  thereof.  The Performance  Goals  shall
include  a  threshold Performance Goal under which  no  Incentive
Plan  Awards shall be paid if the threshold goal is not achieved.
With  respect to Participants who are not Covered Employees,  the
Committee may establish such other subjective or objective goals,
including   individual   Performance  Goals,   which   it   deems
appropriate.  The preceding sentence shall also apply to  Covered
Employees  with respect to any Incentive Plan Award not  intended
at   time   of   grant   to   be   "qualified   performance-based
compensation."  Performance Goals may be set at a specific level,
or  may  be  expressed as a relative percentage to the comparable
measure at comparison companies or a defined index.

      2.9.  "Fiscal Year" means the 12-month period beginning  on
each February 1 and ending on the following January 31.

      2.10.      "Related Affiliate" means a business  or  entity
that  is, directly or indirectly, controlled by Wal-Mart  Stores,
Inc.


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(m) - Page 3

PARTICIPATION

     3.1. Eligibility.  Associates eligible to participate in the
MIP shall consist of officers and other key management associates
of  the  Company whom the Committee determines have the potential
to contribute significantly to the success of the Company and its
Related  Affiliates.   For each Fiscal Year the  Committee  shall
determine  which  of  such  officers  and  other  key  management
associates shall participate in the MIP.  For any Fiscal Year for
which   "qualified  performance-based  compensation"  is  to   be
provided, the Committee shall designate the individual or classes
of Covered Employees for such compensation no later than the 90th
day of such Fiscal Year.

      Unless  determined  otherwise  by  the  Committee,  Company
associates  shall not be eligible to participate in the  MIP  for
any  period they are participating in any other incentive program
maintained by the Company or any other Related Affiliate.  At any
time,  including  during a Fiscal Year,  the  Committee  may  add
additional   classes  or  delete  classes   of   associates   for
participation in the Plan as it deems appropriate, except that no
such  change may be made to the extent it would result in a  loss
of  deductibility  under Code Section 162(m) for  any  "qualified
performance-based compensation."


INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS

     4.1. Determination of Incentive Plan Awards.

      (a)   The Committee shall, promptly after the date on which
the  necessary financial, individual or other information  for  a
particular  Fiscal  Year  becomes available,  certify:   (i)  the
degree to which each of the Performance Goals have been attained;
and  (ii)  with respect to each qualifying Participant who  is  a
Covered Employee, the amount of the Incentive Plan Award, if any,
payable to such Participant.  The Committee or its designee shall
likewise certify the amount of the Incentive Plan Award, if  any,
payable  with respect to a qualifying Participant who  is  not  a
Covered Employee.  Any such determination by the Committee or its
designee shall be final and conclusive on all parties, but  shall
be  based on such objective information or financial data  as  is
relevant  to the Performance Goal.  Performance Goals  shall,  to
the   extent   applicable,  be  based  upon  generally   accepted
accounting  principles.  The Committee may rely  conclusively  on
any  such information provided by the Company's certified  public
accountant.

       (b)    Unless   the  Committee  provides  otherwise   when
establishing  the  Performance Goal,  if  the  Company  fails  to
achieve  its threshold Performance Goal, no Incentive Plan  Award
shall   be   paid  even  if  any  applicable  threshold  division
Performance  Goal has been achieved.  Similarly, unless  provided
otherwise  by  the  Committee when establishing  the  Performance
Goal,  if  the Company fails to achieve its threshold Performance
Goal,  no  Incentive  Plan  Award  shall  be  paid  even  if  any
individual  Performance  Goal has been  satisfied.   Participants
whose  Incentive  Plan Award is based the attainment  of  Company
Performance Goals and division/individual Performance Goals shall
earn  the  Company  portion of the Incentive Plan  Award  if  the
Company   attains   its   Performance   Goals,   even   if    the
division/individual Performance Goals are not achieved.


               Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(m) - Page 4

     4.2. Eligibility and Amount of Incentive Plan Award.

     (a)  To be eligible for payment of any Incentive Plan Award,
the Participant must:  (i) be employed by the Company on the last
day  of  the  Fiscal  Year  to which the award  pertains,  unless
termination  is  due  to  the  Participant's  death;  (ii)   have
performed  the  Participant's duties to the satisfaction  of  the
Committee;  (iii)  have  not engaged in any  act  deemed  by  the
Committee to be inimical to the best interest of the Company or a
Related  Affiliate;  and  (iv) otherwise  complied  with  Company
policies at all times prior to the date the Incentive Plan  Award
is  actually paid.  No Incentive Plan Award shall be paid to  any
Participant who does not satisfy each of the above.

      (b)   The  Incentive  Plan Award  shall  be  determined  by
multiplying   the   Incentive  Percentage   applicable   to   the
Participant  by the Participant's rate of base salary  in  effect
for  the last full payroll period of the Fiscal Year to which the
Incentive  Plan  Award pertains.  In no event, however,  will  an
Incentive Plan Award for a Covered Employee exceed two-tenths  of
one  percent (0.20%) of the Company's net income for  the  Fiscal
Year.  In the event of a Participant's death, the Incentive  Plan
Award  shall  be prorated based upon the number of  full  payroll
periods  worked  in  a MIP position for such  Fiscal  Year.   The
Committee  shall  have  the  discretion  and  authority  to  make
adjustments  to any Incentive Plan Award in circumstances  where:
(i)  a  Participant  leaves  the Company  and  is  rehired  as  a
Participant; (ii) a Participant is hired, promoted or transferred
into   a  position  eligible  for  MIP  participation;  (iii)   a
Participant   transfers  between  eligible  MIP  positions   with
different  Incentive  Percentages or Performance  Goals;  (iv)  a
Participant  transfers to a position not eligible to  participate
in  the  MIP; (v) a Participant becomes eligible for an incentive
from  another incentive plan maintained by the Company or Related
Affiliate; (vi) a Participant is on a leave of absence; and (vii)
such  similar circumstances deemed appropriate by the  Committee,
consistent with the purpose and terms of the MIP.

      4.3. Payment of Award.  Incentive Plan Awards will be  paid
in cash by April 15 following the applicable Fiscal Year to which
the   award  pertains.   If,  however,  the  Participant  is   on
administrative suspension at the time payment would otherwise  be
made,  payment shall be delayed until the matter is  resolved  by
the  Company.   No payment in that event shall  be  made  if  the
Committee  determines the qualification requirements  of  Section
4.2.(a) have not been satisfied by the Participant.


ADMINISTRATION

      5.1. Administration.  The MIP shall be administered by  the
Committee.   Subject to the provisions of the MIP, the  Committee
shall  have  full  discretionary  authority  to  administer   and
interpret  the  MIP,  to exercise all powers either  specifically
granted  to it under the MIP or as are necessary or advisable  in
the  administration of the MIP, to prescribe, amend  and  rescind
rules  and regulations relating to the MIP, and to make all other
determinations  necessary or advisable for the administration  of
the  MIP, all of which shall be binding on all persons, including
the  Company, the Participants (or any person claiming any rights
under  the  MIP  from  or  through  any  Participant),  and   any
stockholder  of  the Company.  A majority of the Committee  shall
constitute  a quorum, and the Committee shall act pursuant  to  a


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(m) - Page 5

majority vote or by unanimous written consent.  No member of  the
Board  or  the Committee shall be liable for any action taken  or
determination made in good faith with respect to the MIP  or  any
Incentive Plan Award paid hereunder.

       5.2.   Delegation.   The  Committee   may   delegate   its
responsibilities for administering the MIP to one or more persons
as the Committee deems necessary.  However, the Committee may not
delegate  its  responsibilities under the Plan  relating  to  any
Covered  Employee where such delegation is prohibited under  Code
Section   162(m)   pertaining  to  "qualified   performance-based
compensation."


MISCELLANEOUS

      6.1.  Amendment  and Termination.  The Board  reserves  the
right  to alter, amend, suspend or terminate the MIP in whole  or
in part at any time.  With respect to Covered Employees, any such
amendment shall comply with Code Section 162(m).

      6.2.  No  Guarantee.  While a discretionary Incentive  Plan
Award may have been paid in the past, whether such payments  will
be  made in the future will depend upon various factors, such  as
the  Company's financial condition and performance.  There is  no
guarantee  that  the  Company will pay any such  incentive.   The
Committee  may,  in  its sole discretion,  reduce,  eliminate  or
increase, any Incentive Plan Award, except that the amount of any
Incentive  Plan Award intended to be "qualified performance-based
compensation"  may not be increased above the amount  established
for  the  Performance Goal and Incentive Percentage.  The Company
may  withhold  an Incentive Plan Award, or portions thereof,  for
any    reason   including   gross   misconduct   (e.g.,    theft,
dishonesty/compromised integrity, fraud, harassment, etc.) or any
actions  deemed  to  be  inimical to the best  interests  of  the
Company by the Committee.

      6.3. Tax Withholding.  The Company shall have the right  to
deduct from all payments made under the MIP any federal, state or
local  taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to  such
payments.

     6.4. Governing Law.  The Plan and all rights to an Incentive
Plan  Award hereunder shall be construed in accordance  with  and
governed  by the laws of the State of Arkansas, except  that  any
matters relating to the internal governance of Wal-Mart shall  be
governed by the general corporate laws of the State of Delaware.

      6.5.  Assignment  or  Pledge.  No  rights  under  the  MIP,
contingent  or otherwise, shall be assignable or subject  to  any
encumbrance, pledge or charge of any nature.

      6.6.  Employment.  Neither the adoption of the MIP nor  its
operation  shall in any way affect the rights and  power  of  the
Company  or  any  Related Affiliate to dismiss or  discharge  any
Participants.

      6.7. Death.  In the event of a Participant's death prior to
the  payment of any Incentive Plan Award to which the Participant
is otherwise entitled, payment shall be made to the Participant's


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Exhibit 10(m) - Page 6

then-effective  beneficiary or beneficiaries under  the  Company-
paid group term life arrangement.

     6.8. Rights to Payments.  No absolute right to any Incentive
Plan  Award  shall  be  considered  as  having  accrued  to   any
Participant prior to the close of the Fiscal Year with respect to
which  the  award  is  made.   No  Participant  shall  have   any
enforceable right to receive any Incentive Plan Award  made  with
respect  to  a  Fiscal Year or to retain any  payment  made  with
respect  thereto  if for any reason the requirements  of  Section
4.2.(a) are not satisfied.

      6.9. Prior Plans.  The MIP supercedes and replaces the Wal-
Mart   Stores,  Inc.  Home  Office  Management  Incentive   Plans
effective February 1, 1998.

</TABLE>

The  Company's sales growth of 17% in fiscal 1999, when compared to fiscal 1998,
was attributable to our expansion program and a domestic comparative store sales
increase  of  9%. Expansion for fiscal 1999 included the opening of 37  Wal-Mart
stores,  123  Supercenters (including the conversion  of  88  existing  Wal-Mart
stores),  eight  SAM'S  Club  units,  and the  opening  or  acquisition  of  114
international  units.  International sales accounted for approximately  8.9%  of
total Company sales in fiscal 1999 compared with 6.4% in fiscal 1998. The growth
in  International is partially due to acquisitions during 1999 and 1998. In  the
third  quarter  of fiscal 1998, the Company acquired a controlling  interest  of
Cifra,  S.A  de  C.V. (Cifra) which at acquisition date included  250  units  in
varying formats including Aurreras, Bodegas, Suburbias, Superamas, and Vips.  In
the  fourth  quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company acquired the 21  units  of  the
Wertkauf hypermarket chain in Germany. In fiscal 1999, the Company acquired four
units  in South Korea which were previously operated by Korea Makro. See Note  6
of  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements for additional  information  on
acquisitions.  SAM'S  Club  sales,  as  a percentage  of  total  Company  sales,
decreased from 17.5% in fiscal 1998 to 16.6% in fiscal 1999.

The  sales  increase  of 12% in fiscal 1998 when compared  to  fiscal  1997  was
attributable  to our expansion program and comparative store sales increases  of
6%.  Expansion  for fiscal 1998 included the opening of 37 Wal-Mart  stores,  97
Supercenters  (including the conversion of 75 existing Wal-Mart  stores),  eight
SAM'S  Clubs,  and  the  opening  or acquisition  of  289  international  units,
including   the  various  Cifra  formats.  International  sales  accounted   for
approximately 6.4% of total Company sales in fiscal 1998 compared with  4.8%  in
fiscal 1997. The growth in International is partially due to the acquisition  of
controlling interest of Cifra during the third quarter. SAM'S Club sales,  as  a
percentage of total Company sales, decreased from 18.9% in fiscal 1997 to  17.5%
in fiscal 1998.

Costs and Expenses

Cost  of  sales, as a percentage of sales, decreased, resulting in increases  in
gross  margin of .2% and .4% in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998, respectively. These
improvements  in gross margin occurred even with continued price  rollbacks  and
our continuing commitment to always providing low prices. Lower inventory levels
resulted  in  reduced markdowns and decreased shrink and generated a sustainable
improvement  in profitability without raising prices. The improvement  in  gross
margin  also  occurred  despite higher food department and International  sales,
which generally have lower gross margins than domestic general merchandise. This
effect  is  partially offset by the slower growth of SAM'S Club,  which  is  our
lowest gross margin retail operation.

Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expenses  decreased  .2%  as  a
percentage  of sales in fiscal 1999 when compared with fiscal 1998.  The  strong
sales increase along with lower inventory levels combined to reduce expenses  as
a  percentage  of sales. The expense leverage was mitigated in the  consolidated
results  due to the percentage of the total volume decreasing in the SAM'S  Club
segment, which has lower expenses as a percentage of sales, while the percentage
of  total  volume  increased  in the International  segment,  which  has  higher
expenses  as  a  percentage  of sales than the other operating  segments.  Every
operating  segment was flat or down in expenses as a percent of sales in  fiscal
1999 when compared with fiscal 1998.

Operating,  selling,  general and administrative expenses  increased  .3%  as  a
percentage of sales in fiscal 1998 when compared with fiscal 1997. Approximately
 .2%  of  the increase in fiscal 1998 was due to increases in payroll and related
benefit costs. Additionally, a contributing factor in the increase for the  year
was  the one-time pre-tax charge of $50 million for closing the majority of  the
Bud's Discount City stores during the second quarter of fiscal 1998.

Interest Costs

Interest  costs  decreased  .1% as a percentage of sales  in  fiscal  1999  when
compared  with fiscal 1998. This marks the third consecutive year that  interest
costs  relating  to  debt  have declined. The Company  was  able  to  meet  cash
requirements without short-term borrowings throughout most of fiscal 1999 due to
enhanced  operating  cash  flows. The interest on the Company's  capital  leases
increased over fiscal 1998 due to continuing expansion. Interest costs decreased
in  fiscal  1998  compared  to  fiscal 1997 due primarily  to  lower  short-term
borrowings. Enhanced operating cash flows and lower capital spending enabled the
Company to meet cash requirements without short-term borrowings throughout  most
of  fiscal  1998. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements  for
additional information on interest and debt.

Market Risk

Market  risks relating to the Company's operations result primarily from changes
in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates.

The  Company  enters  into interest rate swaps to minimize the  risk  and  costs
associated  with  financing  activities. The swap agreements  are  contracts  to
exchange  fixed or variable rates for variable or fixed interest  rate  payments
periodically  over  the  life of the instruments. The following  tables  provide
information  about  the  Company's derivative financial  instruments  and  other
financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For  debt
obligations,  the  table  presents principal cash flows  and  related  weighted-
average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps,  the
table  presents  notional  amounts and interest rates  by  contractual  maturity
dates.  The  applicable  floating  rate index  is  included  for  variable  rate
instruments. All amounts are stated in United States dollar equivalents.

The  Company  routinely enters into forward currency exchange contracts  in  the
regular  course  of  business to manage its exposure  against  foreign  currency
fluctuations  on  cross-border  purchases  of  inventory.  These  contracts  are
generally for durations of six months or less. In addition, the Company  entered
into two foreign currency swaps to hedge the net investment in Germany.

The   following  tables  provide  information  about  the  Company's  derivative
financial  instruments, including foreign currency forward  exchange  agreements
and currency swap agreements by functional currency and presents the information
in  United  States  dollar  equivalents. For foreign currency  forward  exchange

result, the Company's financial results could be affected by factors such
as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions
in  the  foreign markets in which the Company does business. The  Company
minimizes  exposure to the risk of devaluation of foreign  currencies  by
operating in local currencies and through buying forward contracts, where
feasible, for known transactions.

All  foreign operations are measured in their local currencies  with  the
exception of Mexico, which operates in a highly-inflationary economy  and
reports operations using United States dollars. Beginning in fiscal 2000,
Mexico  will  no longer be considered a highly-inflationary  economy  and
will  begin  reporting its operations in its local currency. The  Company
does  not  anticipate there will be a material impact on the consolidated
or International segment's results of operations or financial position as
a  result of the change. In fiscal 1999, the foreign currency translation
adjustment increased by $36 million to $509 million primarily due to  the
exchange  rates  in  Brazil and Canada, and in fiscal 1998,  the  foreign
currency translation adjustment increased by $73 million to $473  million
primarily due to the exchange rate in Canada.

The  International segment's operating profit increased from $262 million
in  fiscal  1998  to  $551 million in fiscal 1999. As  noted  above,  the
results  for  fiscal  1999  include the operating  profit  of  Cifra  and
Wertkauf.  Because  the acquisitions occurred during  the  last  half  of
fiscal  1998,  the  additional  operating  profit  resulting  from  these
acquisitions  accounts for a part of the increase  in  the  International
segment's operating profit.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows Information

Cash  flows from operating activities were $7,580 million in fiscal 1999,
up  from  $7,123  million  in fiscal 1998. In fiscal  1999,  the  Company
invested  $3,734  million  in  capital assets,  paid  dividends  of  $693
million,  and  had  a net cash outlay of $855 million  for  acquisitions.
Acquisitions include the purchase of six undeveloped sites and four units
in  Korea  which  had  been  operated by Korea Makro,  and  74  Interspar
hypermarkets  in Germany from Spar Handels AG. See Note  6  of  Notes  to
Consolidated   Financial   Statements  for  additional   information   on
acquisitions.

Company Stock Purchase and Common Stock Dividends

In  fiscal  1999, the Company repurchased over 21 million shares  of  its
common  stock for $1,202 million. In March of 1999 the Company  announced
plans  to increase the existing common stock repurchase program  by  $1.2
billion,  resulting in a total outstanding authorization of  $2  billion.
Additionally,  the Company increased the dividend 29% to $.20  per  share
(after  the  two-for-one common stock split, which was also announced  in
March  of  1999) for fiscal 2000. This marks the 27th consecutive  yearly
increase in dividends.

Borrowing Information

The  Company  had  committed lines of credit with 78  banks,  aggregating
$1,872  million  and informal lines of credit with various  other  banks,
totaling an additional $1,950 million, which were used to support  short-
term  borrowing  and commercial paper. These lines of  credit  and  their
anticipated  cyclical increases were sufficient to finance  the  seasonal
buildups in merchandise inventories and other cash requirements.

The  Company anticipates generating sufficient operating cash flow to pay
the increased dividend and to fund all capital expenditures. Accordingly,
management  does  not  plan to finance future capital  expenditures  with
debt. However, the Company plans to refinance existing long-term debt  as
it  matures  and may desire to obtain additional long-term financing  for
other  uses of cash or for strategic reasons. The Company anticipates  no
difficulty  in  obtaining long-term financing in  view  of  an  excellent
credit  rating and favorable experiences in the debt market in the recent
past.  In  addition  to the available credit lines mentioned  above,  the
Company  may  sell  up  to  $501  million  of  public  debt  under  shelf
registration   statements  previously  filed  with  the   United   States
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Expansion

Domestically,  the Company plans to open approximately  40  new  Wal-Mart
stores  and approximately 150 new Supercenters. Relocations or expansions
of  existing  discount  stores will account for 90 of  the  Supercenters,
while  approximately  60  will  be new locations.  Due  to  the  positive
customer  feedback  on the Neighborhood Market concept,  which  is  being
tested  in  four  locations, the Company plans  to  expand  the  test  to
additional  areas. Also planned for fiscal 2000 are ten  to  fifteen  new
SAM'S  Clubs,  including six relocations. In addition, the  Company  will
remodel  approximately 140 of the existing SAM'S  Clubs  and  expand  one
unit.  In order to serve these and future developments, the Company  will
begin  shipping  from three new distribution centers in the  next  fiscal
year.  Internationally, plans are to develop 75 to 80 new  retail  units.
These  stores  are  planned in Argentina, Brazil, Canada,  China,  Korea,
Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Total planned growth represents approximately 34
million square feet of net additional retail space.

Total  planned  capital  expenditures for fiscal  2000  approximate  $4.9
billion.  We plan to finance our expansion primarily with operating  cash
flows.

Year 2000 Issue State of Readiness

Historically,  computer software has been programmed to make  assumptions
about  the  century  when  given a date that  only  uses  two  digits  to
represent  the  year.  Although  these assumptions  have  been  perfectly
acceptable  the past few decades, they are a potential cause for  concern
for  software  used  in  the  year 2000 and  beyond.  Specifically,  this
abbreviated date format makes it difficult for an application or computer
user  to  distinguish  between dates starting with  19xx  and  20xx.  The
Company has been evaluating and adjusting all of its known date-sensitive
systems  and equipment for Year 2000 compliance, including those  systems
and  equipment  which support the Company's International  segment.   The
assessment phase of the Year 2000 project is substantially  complete  and


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Annual Report - Page 25

included  both  information  technology, such as  point-of-sale  computer
systems,  as  well  as  non-information  technology  equipment,  such  as
warehouse conveyor systems. All internal coding conversions are complete.
Some  third-party applications representing less than  1%  of  the  total
application  inventory  remain to be converted,  these  applications  are
dependent on vendor upgrade availability and will be completed by October
1999. Virtually all the conversions were performed or are expected to  be
performed by Company associates.

The  next  phase  of  the  Company's Year 2000 project,  complete  system
testing, began during the second quarter of fiscal 1999. The first  phase
of  testing  has  been  completed  on  critical  systems.  Thus  far,  no
significant  issues  have been detected in the testing.  A  second,  more
comprehensive phase of testing, is scheduled for the March 1999  to  July
1999  timeframe. A final test cycle is planned for October 1999 to ensure
all version levels, upgrades, new releases and enhancements are Year 2000
compliant.

The  total  incremental estimated cost directly related to the Year  2000
remedy is $27 million. Approximately $17.5 million of the cost is related
to  reprogramming,  replacement,  extensive  testing  and  validation  of
software,  which is being expensed as incurred, while approximately  $9.5
million  is related to acquisition of hardware. Approximately $8  million
of  the $27 million cost of conversion has been incurred as of the end of
the  fourth  quarter of fiscal 1999. The majority of the remaining  costs
include  future  testing  of the systems and the purchase  of  additional
equipment.  All  of these costs are being funded through  operating  cash
flows.  These  costs  are not a significant component  of  the  Company's
overall  information technology budget. The Company's Information Systems
Division did not defer any information technology projects last  year  to
address  the Year 2000 issue. During fiscal 2000 the Company still  plans
to  complete  and  implement  over half of the  normal  project  load  in
priority sequence.

In  addition to internal Year 2000 implementation activities, the Company
is communicating with other companies with which our systems interface or
on  which it relies to determine the extent to which those companies  are
addressing  their  Year 2000 compliance. Testing began during  the  third
quarter of fiscal year 1999 and will be substantially complete by October
31,  1999.  Thus  far, no significant issues have been  detected  in  the
testing  process. There can be no assurance that there  will  not  be  an
adverse effect on the Company if third parties, such as utility companies
or merchandise suppliers, do not convert their systems in a timely manner
and  in  a  way  that is compatible with the Company's systems.  However,
management  believes that ongoing communication with  and  assessment  of
these third parties should minimize these risks.

The  Company  anticipates minimal business disruption  will  occur  as  a
result  of Year 2000 issues; however, possible consequences include,  but
are  not  limited  to, loss of communications links  with  certain  store
locations,  loss  of  electric power, inability to process  transactions,
send purchase orders, or engage in similar normal business activities. In
addition,  since  there is no uniform definition of Year 2000  compliance
and  not  all  customer situations can be anticipated,  the  Company  may
experience  an increase in sales returns of merchandise that may  contain
hardware or software components. If returns of merchandise increase, such
returns  are  not  expected  to be material to  the  Company's  financial
condition.

Although the Company has not finalized its contingency plans for possible
Year  2000  issues,  initial  analysis and planning  is  underway.  Where
needed, the Company will establish contingency plans based on its  actual
testing  experience  with  its supplier base and  assessment  of  outside
risks.  The Company anticipates the majority of its contingency plans  to
be in place by October 31, 1999.

The  cost  of  the  conversions and the completion  dates  are  based  on
management's best estimates and may be updated as additional  information
becomes  available.  Readers are referred to the  next  section  of  this
report, which addresses forward-looking statements made by the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

The   consolidated   financial  statements  include   the   accounts   of
subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions have been  eliminated
in consolidation.

Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers investments with a maturity of three months or less
when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

The  Company uses the retail last in first out (LIFO) method for domestic
Wal-Mart discount stores and Supercenters and cost LIFO for SAM'S  Clubs.
International inventories are on other cost methods. Inventories are  not
in excess of market value.

Pre-opening costs

During fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position (SOP) 98-5,
"Reporting  on  the Costs of Start-Up Activities." The SOP requires  that
the  costs  of  start-up  activities, including  organization  costs,  be
expensed  as  incurred. The impact of the adoption of  SOP  98-5  was  $8
million  net of taxes. Due to the immateriality to the Company's  results
of  operations, the initial application was not reported as a  cumulative
effect  of a change in an accounting principle. The impact of the  change
did not have a material effect on any of the years presented.

Interest during construction

In  order that interest costs properly reflect only that portion relating
to current operations, interest on borrowed funds during the construction
of   property,  plant  and  equipment  is  capitalized.  Interest   costs
capitalized were $41 million, $33 million and $44 million in  1999,  1998
and 1997, respectively.

Financial instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes other than
trading to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies  and
to  minimize  the  risk  and cost associated with  financing  and  global
operating activities. Contracts that effectively meet risk reduction  and
correlation  criteria  are  recorded using hedge  accounting.  Unrealized
gains  and  losses  resulting from market movements are  not  recognized.
Hedges  of firm commitments  are deferred and recognized when the  hedged
transaction occurs.

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-
line  basis  over  the periods that expected economic  benefits  will  be
provided. Management estimates such periods of economic benefits using
factors such as entry barriers in certain countries, operating rights and
estimated lives of other operating assets acquired. The realizability  of
goodwill  and other intangibles is evaluated periodically when events  or
circumstances  indicate  a possible inability  to  recover  the  carrying
amount.  Such  evaluation  is  based  on   cash  flow  and  profitability
projections  that incorporate the impact of existing Company  businesses.
The  analyses  necessarily  involve significant  management  judgment  to
evaluate  the  capacity  of  an  acquired  business  to  perform   within
projections.  Historically, the Company has generated sufficient  returns
from  acquired businesses to recover the cost of the goodwill  and  other
intangible assets. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, net  of
accumulated amortization, included in the consolidated balance sheets  is
$2,538 million and $1,887 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Long-lived assets

The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets and certain intangible
assets  when  indicators of impairments exist and if  the  value  of  the
assets is impaired, an impairment loss would be recognized.

Comprehensive income

In  fiscal  1999,  the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  130,  "Reporting Comprehensive  Income."  This  statement
establishes  standards for reporting and display of comprehensive  income
and  its components. The Company has reclassified all years presented  to
reflect  comprehensive  income  and its components  in  the  consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity.

Stock split

On  March 4, 1999, the Company announced a two-for-one stock split issued
in  the  form of a 100% stock dividend. The date of record is  March  19,
1999,  and it will be distributed April 19, 1999. Consequently, the stock
option  data and per share data have been restated to reflect  the  stock
split.

Advertising costs

Advertising  costs are expensed as incurred and were $405  million,  $292
million and $249 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Operating, selling and general and administrative expenses

Buying,  warehousing  and  occupancy costs  are  included  in  operating,
selling and general and administrative expenses.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation  and  amortization  for  financial  statement  purposes   is
provided  on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives  of
the various assets. For income tax purposes, accelerated methods are used
with  recognition  of  deferred income taxes for the resulting  temporary
differences. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

Building and improvements                        5-33 years
Fixtures and equipment                           5-12 years
Transportation equipment                         2-5 years
Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets    20-40 years


Costs of computer software

In  March  1998,  the  Accounting Standards  Executive  Committee  issued
Statement  of Position (SOP) 98-1, "Accounting For the Costs of  Computer
Software  Developed For or Obtained For Internal Use." The  SOP  will  be
effective  for  the  Company beginning February 1,  1999.  The  SOP  will
require  the capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection  with
developing  or  obtaining  software for internal  use.  Currently,  costs
related to developing internal-use software are expensed as incurred. The
Company  does  not  anticipate there will be a  material  impact  on  the
results of operations or financial position after SOP 98-1 is adopted.


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Annual Report - Page 31

Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

In  June  1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No.  133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
The  Statement  will be effective for the Company beginning  February  1,
2000.  The new Statement requires all derivatives to be recorded  on  the
balance  sheet  at  fair value and establishes accounting  treatment  for
three  types  of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value  of  assets,
liabilities,  or firm commitments; hedges of the variable cash  flows  of
forecasted transactions; and hedges of foreign currency exposures of  net
investments   in  foreign  operations.  The  Company  is  analyzing   the
implementation requirements and currently does not anticipate there  will
be  a  material impact on the results of operations or financial position
after the adoption of Statement No. 133.

Net income per share

Basic  net  income per share is based on the weighted average outstanding
common  shares.  Dilutive net income per share is based on  the  weighted
average  outstanding  shares  reduced by the  dilutive  effect  of  stock
options.

Foreign currency translation

The assets and liabilities of most foreign subsidiaries are translated at
current  exchange  rates  and  any related  translation  adjustments  are
recorded  as a component of accumulated comprehensive income.  Operations
in Mexico operate in highly inflationary economies and certain assets are
translated  at historical exchange rates and all translation  adjustments
are  reflected  in  the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Beginning  in
fiscal 2000, Mexico will no longer be considered highly inflationary  and
will begin reporting operations in local currency.

Estimates and assumptions

The  preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting principles requires  management  to  make
estimates  and  assumptions. These estimates and assumptions  affect  the
reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of  contingent
assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  consolidated  financial
statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform  to
current presentations.



2 Defined Contribution Plans

The Company maintains profit sharing plans under which most full-time and
many  part-time  associates become participants  following  one  year  of
employment  and a 401(k) plan in which the same associates may  elect  to
contribute up to 10% of their earnings.

The  Company will make annual contributions to these plans on  behalf  of
all  eligible  associates,  including  those  who  have  not  elected  to
contribute to the 401(k) plan.

Annual  Company  contributions are made at the  sole  discretion  of  the
Company,  and were $388 million, $321 million and $247 million  in  1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.

At  January  31,  1999  and  1998,  the Company  had  letters  of  credit
outstanding  totaling $767 million and $673 million, respectively.  These
letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory.

Under  shelf registration statements previously filed with the Securities
and   Exchange   Commission,  the  Company  may  issue  debt   securities
aggregating $501 million.


4 Financial Instruments

Interest rate instruments
The  Company  enters into interest rate swaps to minimize the  risks  and
costs  associated with its financing activities. The swap agreements  are
contracts  to  exchange  fixed or variable rate  interest  for  fixed  or
variable  interest  rate  payments periodically  over  the  life  of  the
instruments. The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid
or  received  and  do  not represent the exposure  due  to  credit  loss.
Settlements of interest rate swaps are accounted for by recording the net
interest  received  or  paid as an adjustment to interest  expense  on  a
current  basis. These instruments are not recorded on the balance  sheet,
and as of January 31, 1999 and 1998, are as follows:

Foreign exchange instruments
The  Company has entered into two foreign currency swap agreements to hedge  its
net  investment in Germany. In fiscal 1998, the Company entered into  a  foreign
currency  swap where it will pay 1,960 million in German Deutschemarks  in  2003
and  will  receive $1,101 million in United States Dollars. In fiscal 1999,  the
Company entered into a foreign currency swap where it will pay 1,360 million  in
German  Deutschemarks  in 2004 and will receive $809 million  in  United  States
Dollars.

The  Company  routinely enters into forward currency exchange contracts  in  the
regular  course  of  business to manage its exposure  against  foreign  currency
fluctuations  on  cross-border  purchases  of  inventory.  These  contracts  are
generally for short durations of six months or less and are insignificant to the
Company's operations or financial position. There were approximately $46 million
notional outstanding at January 31, 1999.

Fair value of financial instruments
     Cash and cash equivalents: The carry amount approximates fair value due  to
the short maturity of these instruments.
     Long-term  debt: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt,  including
current maturities, approximates $8,323 million at January 31, 1999 and is based
on  the  Company's  current  incremental borrowing rate  for  similar  types  of
borrowing arrangements.
    Interest rate instruments: The fair values are estimated amounts the Company
would receive or pay to terminate the agreements as of the reporting dates.
    Foreign currency contracts: The fair value of foreign currency contracts are
estimated by obtaining quotes from external sources.

6 Acquisitions

On  January  1,  1999, the Company took possession of 74 units  from  the
Interspar hypermarket chain in Germany. The units were acquired from Spar
Handels  AG,  a  German  company that owns multiple  retail  formats  and
wholesale  operations  throughout  Germany.  The  transaction  closed  on
December  29,  1998; therefore, the assets are included in the  Company's
consolidated balance sheet and the results of operations will be included
beginning  in  fiscal  2000.  The transaction  has  been  recorded  as  a
purchase.  The net assets and liabilities acquired are recorded  at  fair
value. Resulting goodwill is being amortized over 40 years.

In  July  1998,  the  Company  extended its  presence  in  Asia  with  an
investment  in  Korea. The Company acquired a majority interest  in  four
units  as  well as six undeveloped sites. The four units were  previously
operated  by  Korea Makro. The transaction has been accounted  for  as  a
purchase.  The new assets and liabilities acquired are recorded  at  fair
value.  The  goodwill is being amortized over 40 years.  The  results  of
operations since the effective date of the acquisition have been included
in the Company's results.

A merger of the Mexican joint venture companies owned by Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc.  and  Cifra,  S.A.  de  C.V.  (Cifra)  with,  and  into  Cifra,  was
consummated  with  an  effective merger date of September  1,  1997.  The
Company  received voting shares of Cifra equaling approximately 33.5%  of
the  outstanding  voting shares of Cifra in exchange  for  the  Company's
joint  venture  interests having a net book value of  approximately  $644
million.

The  Company  then acquired 593,100,000 shares of the Series  "A"  Common
Shares  and  Series  "B" Common Shares of Cifra, for  approximately  $1.2
billion.  The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase.  The  net
assets  and  liabilities acquired are recorded at fair  value.  Resulting
goodwill is being amortized over 40 years. As a result of the merger  and
tender  offer,  Wal-Mart  holds a majority interest  of  the  outstanding
voting  shares of Cifra. The results of operations for Cifra,  since  the
effective merger date, have been included in the Company's results.

In December 1997, the Company acquired the Wertkauf hypermarket chain in
Germany, as well as certain real estate. The 21 hypermarkets are one-stop
shopping  centers that offer a broad assortment of high  quality  general
merchandise  and food and are similar to the Wal-Mart Supercenter  format
in  the  United  States.  The transaction has been  accounted  for  as  a
purchase. Net assets and liabilities of Wertkauf and the real estate  are
recorded  at fair value. The goodwill is being amortized over  40  years.
The  transaction closed on December 30, 1997; therefore, the  assets  are
included  in  the  January 31, 1998 consolidated balance  sheet  and  the
results of operations are included in fiscal 1999.


                Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Annual Report - Page 35

In  December  1997,  the Company acquired the minority  interest  in  its
Brazilian  joint venture from Lojas Americanas, and then  sold  a  lesser
share  to  an  individual. The purchase price of  the  minority  interest
approximated  book value. Because the transaction closed on December  30,
1997,  the  results of operations for fiscal 1998 include  the  Company's
original ownership percentage of the joint venture.

Pro   forma  results  of  operations  are  not  presented  due   to   the
insignificant differences from historical results, both individually  and
in  the  aggregate. The fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded
as a result of these transactions is as follows (in millions):

7 Stock Option Plans

At January 31, 1999, 131 million shares of common stock were reserved for
issuance  under stock option plans. The options granted under  the  stock
option  plans  expire ten years from the date of grant.  Options  granted
prior to November 17, 1995, may be exercised in nine annual installments.
Generally,  options  granted  on  or after  November  17,  1995,  may  be
exercised in seven annual installments. The Company has elected to follow
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock  Issued
to  Employees" (APB 25) and related interpretations in accounting for its
employee  stock  options because the alternative  fair  value  accounting
provided   under   FASB  Statement  123,  "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation," (FAS No. 123) requires the use of option valuation  models
that  were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under
APB  25,  because  the  exercise price of the  Company's  employee  stock
options  equals the market price of the underlying stock on the  date  of
the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.

Pro  forma  information, regarding net income and income  per  share,  is
required  by  FAS  No.123 and has been determined as if the  Company  had
accounted  for  its  associate stock option plans under  the  fair  value
method  of  that statement. The fair value of these options was estimated
at  the  date  of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing  model
with  the  following assumption ranges: risk-free interest rates  between
7.2%  and 4.4%, dividend yields between 0.4% and 1.2%, volatility factors
between .23 and .29, and an expected life of the option of 7.4 years  for
the  options issued prior to November 17, 1995, and 5.8 years for options
issued thereafter.


The  Black-Scholes  option  valuation model  was  developed  for  use  in
estimating  the  fair  value of traded options,  which  have  no  vesting
restrictions  and are fully transferrable. In addition, option  valuation
methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions including  the
expected  stock  price volatility. Because the Company's associate  stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options,  and  because  changes in the subjective input  assumptions  can
materially affect the fair value estimates, in management's opinion,  the
existing  models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure  of
the  fair  value of its associate stock options. Using the  Black-Scholes
option  evaluation model, the weighted average value of  options  granted
during the years ending January 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, were $14, $7 and
$4 per option, respectively.

The  effect of applying the fair value method of FAS No. 123 to the stock
option  grants  subsequent to February 1, 1995, does not  result  in  net

Present value of minimum lease payments                          $ 2,805
</TABLE>

Certain of the leases provide for contingent additional rentals based  on
percentage of sales. Such additional rentals amounted to $49 million, $46
million   and   $51  million  in  1999,  1998  and  1997,   respectively.
Substantially all of the store leases have renewal options for additional
terms from five to 25 years at comparable rentals.

The Company has entered into lease commitments for land and buildings for
47  future locations. These lease commitments with real estate developers
provide  for  minimum  rentals  for 20 to  25  years,  excluding  renewal
options,  which  if  consummated based on current  cost  estimates,  will
approximate $49 million annually over the lease terms.

9 Segments

The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the operation
of mass merchandising stores located in all 50 states, Argentina, Canada,
Germany, and Puerto Rico, and through joint ventures in China and  Korea,
and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico.

The Company identifies segments based on management responsibility within
the United States and geographically for all international units. The Wal-
Mart   Stores  segment  includes  the  Company's  discount   stores   and
Supercenters  in the United States. The SAM'S Club segment  includes  the
warehouse membership clubs in the United States. The Company's operations
in  Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, China and Korea are  consolidated
using a December 31 fiscal year end, generally due to statutory reporting
requirements.  The  Company's operations in Canada and  Puerto  Rico  are
consolidated  using  a  January  31  fiscal  year  end.  There  were   no
significant  intervening events which materially affected  the  financial
statements.  The  Company measures segment profit  as  operating  profit,
which  is  defined  as income before interest expense, income  taxes  and
minority  interest.  Information  on segments  and  a  reconciliation  to
income,  before  income taxes and minority interest, are as  follows  (in
millions):

International  long-lived assets excluding goodwill are  $4,044  million,
$3,537  million and $1,199 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,  respectively.
Additions  to  international long-lived assets are $732  million,  $2,401
million  and  $317  million  in 1999, 1998 and  1997,  respectively.  The
International segment includes all international real estate. All of  the
real estate in the United States is included in the "Other" category  and
is  leased to Wal-Mart Stores and SAM'S Club. The revenues in the "Other"
category  result from sales to third parties by McLane Company,  Inc.,  a
wholesale distributor.

McLane  offers a wide variety of grocery and non-grocery products,  which
it  sells  to  a  variety of retailers including the  Company's  Wal-Mart
Stores  and SAM'S Club segments. McLane is not a significant segment  and
therefore, results are not presented separately.

obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements  are
free  of  material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on  a  test
basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the  financial
statements.  An  audit also includes assessing the accounting  principles
used  and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the  overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion,  the  financial statements referred  to  above  present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position  of
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Subsidiaries at January 31, 1999 and 1998,  and
the  consolidated results of their operations and their  cash  flows  for
each  of  the  three  years  in the period ended  January  31,  1999,  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
